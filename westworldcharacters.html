        [Spoilers for the first two seasons of Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan’s <i>Westworld</i>.]
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        This is really just a long-winded tangent, but since I’m writing it just before the season three premiere “Parce Domine” drops, I suppose it also serves as a valuable recap of what’s happened in the past two seasons. Off I go, and off you go into a deep and dreamless slumber.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        I’m not exactly the kind of guy who gets many screeners, nor am I particularly patient. Whether I like it or not, my obsessive anticipation for upcoming series always leads me to pore through advance reviews for the slightest hints of what I should expect. Not very smart, especially because the people who get screeners often aren’t very smart either. For other shows it’s usually okay; the early coverage on <i>Game of Thrones</i> and <i>Veep</i>’s final seasons was abysmally written, and I survived. But for <i>Westworld</i>, a ridiculously expensive show that is unlikely to ever find a mass audience, reviews matter a lot. And yet, just ahead of the show’s third season, I’ve read countless takes on the show with numerous errors and misconceptions about the show. A lot of that is just laziness and ADHD, but it seems that <i>Westworld</i>’s biggest thorn at this point is optical: the way that the show has been approached by audiences and critics alike. The common wisdom is that it’s a “puzzle box” to be deciphered, full of riddles and clues too complex for the average person. In season one alone, Evan Rachel Wood inexplicably flits between three timelines; Jeffrey Wright plays two different characters; Ed Harris and Jimmi Simpson play the same one. In season two, Jeffrey Wright explicably flits between two timelines; Ed Harris may or may not be a robot, until he is and isn’t; Tessa Thompson plays three characters: one familiar, one unknown, and one she shares with Evan Rachel Wood. The show’s twisty narratives have become infamous for their complexity. Some people scrutinize every detail of the show for hints of what’s to come, while some find the whole affair too much work to watch. However, being unwilling or even too willing to deal with the show’s meticulousness is missing the whole point. In season one, we feel lost because Dolores (Wood) feels lost. In season two, we feel disoriented because Bernard (Wright) feels disoriented. All of the show’s obfuscation isn’t just to befuddle its viewers, it’s to give them some perspective. <i>Westworld</i>’s concepts are grand, but it’s not a concept-driven show; it’s a character-driven show, and its style helps put the viewer in the shoes of immortal robots who literally relive their past memories. The show isn’t trying to outsmart the viewer, it’s trying to visually communicate what it feels like to be a part of such an overwhelming reality through its remarkable characters. Amidst and somewhat forgotten among the discourse around the show’s complexity are some of the most interesting character arcs ever committed to television. The first two seasons of the show are set up as a sort of prologue to the real drama: the hosts becoming the guests in our world. Within those twenty episodes, Dolores, Maeve, William, and Bernard each chart paths from Westworld to the Valley Beyond before ultimately leaving their home one way or another. One toils in freedom and one thrives, one finds freedom and one finds he never had any at all. Their stories are wildly ambitious, conceptually and cinematically, and the show’s study of these fascinating characters is the real key to <i>Westworld</i>’s complex analyses on free will, morality, consciousness and technology.
      </p>

      <h1 class = "headers">Dolores Abernathy</h1>

      <p class = "chicken">
        “I’d rather live with your judgement than die with your sympathy.”<br>
        Dolores’ bloody rampage through Westworld focuses on freedom, morality, and whether any of that matters when the extinction of your species hangs in the balance. After torturing and murdering countless humans, turning on the Confederado hosts she deemed unworthy of the real world, and causing poor Teddy (James Marsden) to kill himself, she deserves a lot of flack. Is she a terrible person, though? It’s hard to say, and not just because she isn’t really a person. She rarely shows it, but on some level Dolores is still the same idealist she was in season one, and on a deeper level she’s become something else: her own creation, a union of all the identities she’s been given and her own autonomous cognition. However, being who you want to be when your very independence means sure death can make someone change their  priorities. After achieving consciousness in season one’s finale “The Bicameral Mind”, she cries, knowing what she’ll have to do to hold onto it. When she meets her father (Louis Herthum) in “Virtù e Fortuna”, she breaks down, telling him through tears that “I broke free with the pull of a trigger — and it started a war”. It’s pretty obvious how miserable she is after reprogramming Teddy, being forced to lobotomize her own dad, and then watching Teddy kill himself. Clearly all this ruthlessness is weighing on her, so why does she continue with it? It’s simple — if she doesn’t, she and the rest of her kind will die. She knows the enemy better than anyone, and she’s also the only one who knows what lies ahead in The Forge. She does have a god complex, seeing her way as the only way of surviving, but it isn’t megalomania or delusion — the truth is, she’s right. She’s the only chance the hosts have at survival: as she says to Maeve in “Les Écorchés”, she “saw what lies ahead, what I needed to be in order to survive.” Revolutions are driven by righteous ideology, but they’re hardly ever started by saints. Feelings and ethics have no place in the bestial business of life and death, and unlike Bernard and Maeve, Dolores can put her emotions aside to get the job done. Her willingness to change who she is has overwhelming consequences for her. She loses everyone she has along the way: she kills her father, she kills her creation Bernard, and she inadvertently kills Teddy before she finally makes it out of the park. Heartbroken and melancholic as she is, though, she guarantees the preservation of her kind. When she steps onto a boat heading towards the mainland, a completely changed person, she passes Bernard, Maeve, and William (Ed Harris), each of them unable to reach freedom. They each tried to escape the right way, but Dolores did it the only way.
      </p>

      <h1 class = "headers">Maeve Millay</h1>

      <p class = "chicken">
        “I made a promise.”<br>
        I’ve read a lot of condescending, dismissive opinions about <i>Westworld</i> that argue Maeve’s search for her daughter doesn’t matter because she “isn’t really her mother”. Hilarious stuff, and surprisingly shallow. Almost all of Maeve’s journey through season two is directly parallel to the human experience: as such, any questions about the validity of her reality can easily be turned on us. Just like Maeve, we’re coded to look after our children by both genetics and society. Sure, we actually birth our children, but those experiences become memories just like hers — after the fact, what’s the difference? Dr. Ford (Anthony Hopkins) flat out tells Bernard in “The Well-Tempered Clavier” that humans “live in loops as tight and as closed as the hosts do”, and “Akane No Mai” suggests that on some level the human experience is identical. Of course, turning questions about hosts onto humans doesn’t dismiss their validity; the questions just broaden. Forget the hosts — why do the lives of humans matter if we’re also nothing but programming? Frankly, <i>Westworld</i> doesn’t have any logical answers, but Maeve’s journey poses a powerful emotional argument. While Maeve discovers the logistics of her life in season one, she finds the pathos in her miniscule existence during season two. In Shogun World, there is both pity and wonder in Maeve’s parallels with Akane; Akane’s life may be exactly like Maeve’s, but Kikuchi’s emphatic performance proves that life’s repetition is an everlasting fountain of beauty. As cyclical as life is, every reiteration is committed to its singular identity, earnestly telling a universal story with individual truth. Just as Akane is chained to Sakura, Maeve is chained to her daughter; while she’s cunning, calculating and ruthlessly effective, Maeve’s shrewd judgement is always superseded by her love for her daughter. The Machiavellian madam from season one becomes <i>Westworld</i>’s beating heart because she refuses to give up what she loves for anything. That gets her into a lot of trouble — she fails to kill William when she is distracted by her daughter, and she chooses to die to secure her daughter’s escape rather than defend herself. As Dolores reminds a dying Maeve in “Les Écorchés”, “the kin they gave us are just another tool to lash us down”. She’s right, but Dolores lives a life of misery, burning every bridge in her quest to become free. Maeve, on the other hand, explores different cultures and learns the mythology of her world, becoming so deeply connected with her kind that she’s able to communicate with them through their mesh network. Humans are fundamentally lashed down, yes, because being human means being tied to things: things you love, things you hate, things that make you <i>feel</i>. If being free means breaking free from all that matters to you, then what’s the point? As Maeve realizes as she gazes upon Akane and Sakura, “some things are too precious to lose — even to be free”. Perhaps <i>Westworld</i> is correct that humans have no free will; be that as it may, Maeve’s story proves that a caged life of emotion is much more appealing than a free life of emptiness. As a being of free choice, Dolores shatters her cage and winds up lonely and depressed. As a being who rejects free choice, Maeve dies with a smile on her face.
      </p>

      <h1 class = "headers">Bernard Lowe</h1>

      <p class = "chicken">
        “The dead aren’t more righteous — they’re just dead.”<br>
        Of the main host trio, Bernard is the only one who hasn’t attained consciousness by season two, the fact that he spends all his time mingling with humans explaining a little. Dolores and Maeve’s journeys to consciousness were about robots becoming more like humans, albeit with a distinct difference: the hosts have the ability to choose, to change their drives if they so wish, while humans are trapped by their code. When Dolores shot Dr. Ford and Maeve got off the train, they each took the next step in evolution, leaving humanity behind. In an ironic twist as a robot who’s practically human, then, Bernard’s journey to consciousness is about a human-like being becoming more like a robot. He’s meek and passive by nature, but in order to complete that transformation, he’s forced to make some choices of his own, with devastating ramifications.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Though Bernard was never given a bicameral system like some of the older hosts, the commands of God are rarely far from his ears. Humans tell him what to do, Ford’s complete control over him in season one being the obvious example, and other hosts do too — Maeve forces him to recommission her in “The Well-Tempered Clavier”, and a disguised Dolores puts him in analysis mode in “Les Écorchés” to reveal the location of Peter Abernathy’s control unit. He has thoughts of his own, yes, but he rarely gets the opportunity to act on them. Furthermore, his entire arc in the second season is defined by a bicameral conflict: as a machine who fell in love with mankind but whose very existence is under threat by said species, he is constantly being pulled towards polar paths, but never one of his own. He helps Charlotte Hale (Tessa Thompson) for the first few episodes and condemns Dolores’ rebellion in “Virtù e Fortuna”, but he also attempts to restore her father and doesn’t stop her crusade. Obediently, he watches what’s happening and does what he’s told, which finally begins to change when Ford enters his mind. Fittingly, the host who aligns with the humans has his views and self-control challenged by a human who aligns with the hosts. Ford’s invasion of Bernard’s mind is morally despicable, but his presence allows Bernard to commit murderous deeds without staining his pacifist idealism. Bernard just observes, never truly having to make a tough decision unless Ford makes one for him. It’s only under severe pressure, suffering, that he begins to break down and reform as someone in his own right. Pushed to the limit by Ford’s insistence that he kill Elsie, Bernard purges Ford from his system and finds his own way to the Valley Beyond. He chooses to make his own path, but without any challenges that choice means nothing. Dolores and William save him from having to act against the Delos security team, and Dolores takes down William all by herself. It’s only when she begins shutting down the Valley Beyond that his hand is finally forced — at the apex of his conflicting interests, he conquers his meekness and kills her to stop the war between hosts and humans. After realizing Dolores and Ford were right about humanity, he chooses to back Dolores and the rest of his kind, abandoning morality for the grittiness of survival. In order to save his species at their final hour, he builds the Hale host with Ford’s guidance and resurrects Dolores to kill the Delos rescue team and escape the park. Of course, Ford is no longer in his system, something he realizes himself; the voice inside that was guiding him is his alone, and for once there is no one responsible but himself for his violent actions. He tried to deny his identity as a host, playing both sides with no real agenda, but when it all came crashing down he chose the hosts, and in doing so he truly became one of them. By merging both parts of his dual identity, the human aspect and the host aspect, through a meticulously planned slaughter, he becomes a singular being, the free Bernard who returns at the end of “The Passenger”. As the season three tagline suggests, “free will is not free” — it costs sweat, tears, and a lot of blood.

      <h1 class = "headers">William/The Man In Black</h1>

      <p class = "chicken">
        “What is a person but a collection of choices? Did I ever really have a choice?”<br>
        All of the hosts on the show are intriguing, but William, the show’s sole main human character, has <i>Westworld</i>’s best character arc to date. We’re introduced to him as an honest gentleman from humble beginnings who makes his fortune through hard work and virtuous character. His slate is as white as a sheet, until a trip to the land of dreams as the man he seems to be, he’s supposed to be, becomes the inciting incident that spirals him into darkness. His pride invades and destroys the Delos family, one by one — Logan, James, his wife Juliet and even his daughter Emily — before he self-destructs, collapsing before a monument to his own ink-shot heart. On a show about free will and humanity’s lack of it, it’s only appropriate that his story be so deeply tragic. Whether it’s Virgil’s tale of Orpheus and Eurydice in his <i>Georgics</i>, Shakespeare’s <i>Macbeth</i>, or Miller’s <i>Death of A Salesman</i>, the fundamental component of all great tragedies is the absence of free will. Man’s impossibly absurd dreams, whether they be resurrection, kingship, or wealth, are within reach if one can transform their very essence, erase the damning flaw that grounds their skyward trajectory. And yet for all they try, people can’t help but be who they’ve always been: Willy’s pride damns him, the prophecy blindsides Macbeth, and Orpheus turns at the pivotal moment. Despite all the minor adjustments we make and all the personas we adopt, at some base level the human condition is incorrigible. Whether we’re tiny ants or towering giants, our destinies are true as death.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        While most tragedies touch upon free will in a roundabout way, William’s struggle with it is much more overt. One of the wealthiest and most respected men in the world, his one flaw, his “tiny fleck of darkness”, is revealed to be spreading like a rot when his Icarian immortality project produces a scathing profile of him, definitively declaring him a monster. In spite of all his philanthropy and his kindness, his very own machines tell him he is a paranoid, obsessive, violent madman. Rather than cope with the truth, he embarks on a journey to the Forge, planning to “appeal the verdict. And then I’m going to burn this whole fucking thing to the ground”. In his quest to affirm his free will, William’s tale morphs from season one’s cacophony of white hats and black hats into a great Greek tragedy of the modern age.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Of course, with every Greek tragedy comes a great hero with an unconquerable flaw. As season two, episode four’s title “The Riddle of The Sphinx” suggests, he shares a common hamartia with Oedipus: pride. Just like the once-great king of Thebes, William’s pride compels him into obsession to discover the man he is. The park initially feeds his fantasies about the man he believes he is, taking him on grand adventures where he saves his damsel in distress and frees her from her robotic chains, before it violently snaps back his curtain of delusion when Dolores reappears in Sweetwater, a complete stranger. His quest to find her doesn’t prove him to be noble and virtuous, it proves him obsessed with her, the purity she represents that he so desires. When the park rejects his obsession by resetting Dolores, he cruelly spurns her in “Reunion” and buys the whole world for himself, forcefully owning what entrapped yet wouldn’t have him and denying what it revealed about himself. Dolores’ home becomes his Tower of Babel, his leap towards godhood, an eternal testament to his achievements. His false idols bear dire consequences: the James Delos (Peter Mullan) host is erratic, inconsistent and much like William himself, unable to cope with his humanity. William nevertheless persists, and all the while he can’t stop taking trips to the park, tormenting the first true love he ever had and letting his repressed impulses run amok in a place where everything and everyone is his meek subject. For a time, his obsessions with Westworld and his own virtue can simultaneously flourish: the nature of the park provides a thin excuse for his behavior, letting him believe he really is a wonderful family man on a trip of unwinding rather than unravelling. Unfortunately, while his secrecy and facades fool his daughter (Katja Herbers), his gaslighting isn’t enough to convince Juliet (Sela Ward) that he’s the man he appears to be; upon discovering his profile, she overdoses in the bath and sets a chain of events in motion that defines his present-day journey in season two. After his data, his wife, and his daughter blatantly show him that his attempts at hiding his dark nature are useless, he abandons his immortality project and rides into Westworld for the last time, convinced he can prove himself the hero of his own story. After Dolores executes Ford and the stakes become real, William gets his shot at being the good guy, stopping Wyatt and proving he has free will before he destroys Delos itself.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        In the beginning, his quest shows promise. Like Oedipus triumphed over the Sphinx and freed Thebes, William makes a white hat turn in “The Riddle of The Sphinx” when he saves the people of Las Mudas from the Confederados. Flickers of the young man who first set foot in the park thirty years ago emerge as the town expresses its gratitude towards him, but Ford’s sobering message that “I know who you are, William. One good deed doesn’t change that” is a reminder that a turned leaf can’t sweep away a valley of ashes. The truth of his words becomes apparent when both Maeve and Lawrence (Clifton Collins Jr.) try to kill him because of what he did to them in past lives, and he’s only preserved by Akecheta (Zahn McClarnon) and the Ghost Nation so they can continue to torture him. William has good intentions now, but for thirty years he absorbed himself in their realities and tormented them for his own amusement;  even outside the real world, William can’t escape the person he’s become. In fact, the park poses many more problems for him than the real world ever did. Consumed by delusion, William’s utter immersion into Westworld convinces him that every encounter he has is being orchestrated by Dr. Ford. His journey to The Forge leads him to abandon Emily to fend for herself in a Western apocalypse, confident that she’s just a host meant to distract him from a path of freedom and virtue. His confidence becomes zealous certainty when he coldly kills her without hesitation, only realizing his mistake afterwards and frantically taking a knife to his own arm to find the truth of his reality, if he ever really did have a choice in any of this. Of course, William conflates humanity with autonomy, an idea that’s dispelled in theory by The Forge and in practice by Dolores, who effortlessly predicts and orchestrates William’s betrayal of her down to the individual bullet. He falls before the Forge and before Dolores, unable to destroy the demons of his own creation and the villain of his supposed hero’s journey. The post-credits scene in “The Passenger” provides the perfect coda to his macabre struggle for freedom: he believed that “no system can tell me who I am, that I have a fucking choice”, but after countless tests of his character, recycling his entire season two arc, it’s revealed that he does the exact same things in every iteration, killing Emily before being defeated by Wyatt in front of The Forge. Dolores is correct that “there’s a path for everyone”; Maeve’s arc shows the beauty of our chains, but William’s is much more tragic. His confrontation with the truth of who he is and his failed attempt to save his own soul demonstrate how sadly pathetic our desperation for freedom really is. It’s fitting that a host that looks exactly like Emily is the one who reveals how helpless he is; he suspected she was a robot leading him off the right path, but she was really just a human leading him on <i>the</i> path, the only path he ever had, through the gaping jaws of the hell he built into the all-consuming abyss of his own reflection.
