        [Spoilers for <i>Westworld</i> season three episode five, “Genre”]
      </p>
      <p class="chicken">
        Leave it to HBO to prepare a sardonically appropriate schedule. On June 15, 2014, HBO aired "The Children", the
        <i>Game of Thrones</i> season four finale in which (spoiler alert!) Tyrion kills his father Tywin. That was on
        Father's Day. Four years later on June 17, 2018, William killed his own daughter in "Vanishing Point", also on
        Father's Day. Two years later, <i>Westworld</i> has returned with another perfectly scheduled episode in which
        Dolores completely assumes her Messianic role. Last week I wrote about the noble sacrifice in Dolores' decision
        to solely clone herself, and then "Genre" came along to prove that she's basically a violently-rebranded Jesus.
        After giving everyone the same chance to see their strings as her fellow hosts, liberating them from their
        divine obligations, Dolores' sacrifice tears down civilization to its bestial choice: adaptation or death.
      </p>


      <p class="chicken">
        Just before Serac's (Vincent Cassel) precious Rehoboam collapses, we finally get a glimpse into the man behind
        the machine in this week's revelatory episode. Again, <i>Westworld</i> takes the opportunity to visually connect
        the real world with Delos' theme parks; the shot from "The Mother of Exiles" that strikingly resembled a young
        Ford and his dog Jock is followed up by young Serac running his hand through the vegetation like Maeve's done in
        flashbacks since season one. Whether we get some crazy reveal like Ford secretly being Serac's brother (Ford did
        have a brother, but his name wasn't Engerraund; frankly, no one's brother is named Engerraund) or not, the
        episode further tightens the connection between human and host as Serac plans to save humanity from itself by
        building his own god to control the world towards salvation. Of course, there are always anomalies, "flies in
        the ointment" as Serac says, which have the potential to disrupt Rehoboam's order.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        That brings us to Brazil, where Serac tells the Brazilian president exactly what his next moves are to be. No
        one exactly knows who the trillionaire is, but it's obvious that he's been doing a lot of work behind the
        scenes. After Serac literally got him elected, it seems the president has now been siphoning money from villages
        for nepotistic purposes. Serac threatens to destroy his country's dollar valuation and reinstate someone else
        (the guy with the big mustache, specifically) to replace him, which is actually within his power. Quickly, the
        president caves. In this pointed exchange, the president struggles to swat a fly, recalling Dolores in the
        series pilot "The Original" and reminding us how actually useless he is, following his own loop like Dolores
        was. As the episode shows us later, Serac is terribly effective because he's willing to do anything to maintain
        his order, harming many more than a single fly in the process.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        We continue to see Serac's memories of Rehoboam's creation through the system itself as he speaks to it —
        clearly, someone is accessing his file. Liam Dempsey Sr. (Jefferson Mays) collected extensive data on everyone
        in the world before privacy laws became tighter (<i>Westworld</i> sends out emails about these things, it's
        neat), so a younger Serac (Alexandre Bar) and his brother Jean Mi (Paul Cooper) used his information to develop
        several iterations of the machine that would eventually become Rehoboam. Saul, David, and Solomon all pass by,
        as well as a great deal of Dempsey's patience — Jean blatantly suggests killing him to deal with the issue,
        disturbing Serac, but at last Rehoboam is built, able to analyze stock market trends and return 2000% of their
        initial $5 million investment over a single week. Dempsey became greedy with his newfound power, so they shut
        him out of the system to guarantee the world's stability. However, there were occasionally people who didn't
        follow predictable trends, like Jean himself, notably absent in the present.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Currently, Serac is all alone, and he learns that Dolores has been in San Francisco, Jakarta, Berlin, and most
        importantly Los Angeles, having taken Liam captive to access Rehoboam. Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood), Caleb (Aaron
        Paul), and Liam (John Gallagher Jr.) are all on the move, trying to avoid conflict before Dolores can read
        Serac's files and understand her enemy. As expected, Liam has become the face of Dolores' investment into Delos,
        outbidding Serac's attempted takeover and ensuring Halores can resume host production for a little longer.
        Rehoboam would normally be able to track Dolores' movements by analyzing her past data, but since she doesn't
        exist in it, she's got an edge. Apparently so does Caleb, because when Liam uses his glasses to read his
        profile, he's freaked out to the point where he sticks the Genre he got last episode into Caleb and runs.
        Clearly, Dolores didn't tell us the whole story — before completely tripping, Caleb has an enigmatic memory of
        himself pushing an unseen person somewhere, but that's all we get before the drug kicks in.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Suddenly, Caleb enters a film noir state; the film is almost completely desaturated, and Djawadi's score sounds
        like it's been pulled right out of a Hitchcock movie. They make some uneventful progress, Dolores sending her
        trusty motorcycle away and getting them to a car, but everything's just a tad tense through Caleb's perspective.
        When Incite employees begin tailing them, Aaron Paul and Ramin Djawadi's classical score unite for a bit of
        brilliance: "They're waiting to get us alone... *Dramatic Music* <i>to kill us</i>". Beautiful.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        He's not wrong; it turns out that future amber alerts are actually useful, forcing their car to pull over. Armed
        men approaching, Liam finally realizes that Serac doesn't really care if he's dead and decides to help Dolores,
        giving her his biometrics to override the car and speed them off. In that moment, Caleb "switches genres", the
        escalating intensity morphing his noir reality into an action-packed war movie. Richard Wagner's "Rise of The
        Valkryies", famously used by Francis Ford Coppola in <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, overtakes the narrative as Caleb
        fires a rocket that rises into the sky (like a valkyrie!) before descending on a tailing car in a glorious
        explosion.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Dolores abruptly pulls over the car in the middle of a street and begins raining gunfire on their incoming
        pursuers. As with the car chase, there's a strange lack of thrill in these scenes, especially because everyone's
        ridiculously bad at aiming at immobile targets. Thankfully, Dolores' motorbike intercepts an incoming car and
        slides it off the road before erupting in another glorious explosion, one actually exciting moment before Caleb
        switches to a new genre: romance. The flames of demolition become flames of passion as Francis Lai's <i>Love
          Story</i> theme begins. Now, that's the kind of meta-melodrama that <i>Westworld</i> excels at; Caleb gazes at
        Dolores in a trance, the flames beautifully illuminating her in slow motion. Tragically, Caleb is disrupted from
        his reverie by the arrival of Ash (Lena Waithe) and Giggles (Marshawn Lynch), whose shirt reveals he's really in
        his feelings with every emotion lit up. On the move again, Dolores plans to read Serac's file through Liam's
        biometrics. That can't happen, Liam insists, because his biometric key won't work unless they're actually at
        Incite headquarters, and she "can't be in two places at once". Who's gonna tell him?
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Cue in Tinlores (Tommy Flanagan), who escorts Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) through Incite headquarters on the way to
        the center control. A particularly elegant shot in which both Flanagan and Wright are reflected across a surface
        compliments their heavy conversation: "You've always been of two minds, haven't you, Bernard?" Tinlores refers
        to his indecision between hosts and humans, but also his very identity. "Living another person's life changes
        you. Worlds bleed", he says; the pair have each spent their lives in the bodies of others, and the struggle to
        dissociate individual identities clearly has its toll. Halores and Bernard have clearly shown us the identity
        crisis that can come from inhabiting another person's body, but Tinlores seems relatively functional, using
        Liam's biometrics to access Serac's file and send it to Dolores Prime.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        As Dolores accesses Serac's data, learning what we have about him throughout the flashbacks, Caleb switches to
        some sort of crime or drama genre — point is, the song is Iggy Pop's "Nightclubbing", which featured in
        <i>Trainspotting</i> and now plays as they board a subway train. Haha. "Where are we headed?" Ash asks. "West",
        Dolores simply says as she prepares to release the world's Incite profiles. Liam is not fond of the idea, and he
        makes a good case as to why; should we really know our fates, who we really are and what will become of us?
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Later in the episode, Serac reveals that human extinction would be inevitable if Dempsey released all of
        Incite's information. It's fairly easy to buy that: as Liam surveys his captors with his glasses, he learns that
        Giggles will wind up dead in a ditch at best and that Ash's dedication to her golden boy brother is ultimately
        fruitless considering the dark turn he'll take. Liam himself is worse than he'd care to admit: confronted with
        his attempt to have Dolores killed, he insists "that wasn't my choice. I could never bring myself to hurt you",
        only for Dolores to simultaneously deliver the line verbatim. "Don't forget I know you", she says.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Caleb is still a mystery, but he's definitely backing Dolores, insisting to Liam that "I would rather live in
        chaos than a world controlled by you", which then prompts Dolores to tell Tinlores to release everyone's Incite
        profiles. What the genre is at that moment I can't say, but Djawadi's music is hauntingly elegant; like in "The
        Adversary" when Maeve walked through the Mesa as "Motion Picture Soundtrack" played, we watch firsthand as every
        person in the train sees their pasts, presents, and futures apathetically compiled into the algorithm designed
        to destine their lives. Immediately, disaster ensues: a businessman realizes he's widely loathed, a couple
        quarrels, and a heartbroken mother caresses her young daughter's wrist, which will be slit within five to eight
        years when she kills herself in their bathroom. Just like guests boarding the train into Westworld, humanity has
        found itself on a brand new journey. And like Maeve says in her "Chestnut" monologue, the second they set foot
        on solid ground, they've entered the new world; in that world, they can be whoever the fuck they want.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Bernard, however, can't decide what he wants to be. Tinlores is ready to die for Dolores' cause, but as per
        usual most people lack the Doloreses' conviction (a real tongue-twister). On an escalator, Caleb begins hearing
        The Classic Rock String Quartet's rendition of David Bowie's "Space Oddity"; stepping into the sunlight, Dolores
        reveals she's sent the whole world their Incite profiles. "The right information at the right time is deadlier
        than any weapon", Tinlores says, and the anarchical streets of Los Angeles prove it. "Space Oddity" is
        particularly appropriate, because it's about the disconnect of outer space, and its inspiration from <i>2001: A
          Space Odyssey</i> is another reminder of the depleting humanity that comes from technological achievements. A
        dog free of its leash runs (clever symbol there), couples brawl, people parade in the streets and armed men
        spontaneously attempt murder in the open street; as a guest in this new theme park, however, Dolores is immune
        to their bullets, and saves Caleb before killing their assailants and hiding her bullet holes with a quick
        jacket zip. The gorgeous architecture and the futuristic technology make for a sleek redesign, but it's still as
        wild as the Wild West gets.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Serac is obviously displeased with how things are going, especially considering how much he's sacrificed to get
        where he is. Through the flashbacks, we see that Dempsey's curiosity about Incite's real machinations led him to
        visit Inner Journeys Recovery, where he found Serac testing the aforementioned anomalies to forcibly correct
        them. Among the test subjects? His own brother. Serac tells Dempsey that the people he can't control usually end
        up going to war in order to be killed; horrified, Dempsey attempts to leave the compound, only to discover that
        his jet has been burnt to bits. Confident in the system's assurances that Serac won't hurt him, he's sadly
        mistaken when his head is slammed into debris to preserve a dark secret, mirroring Theresa's execution in
        "Trompe L'Oeil". Even with the lengths he goes to prevent someone from taking down Rehoboam, he's completely
        undermined when Tinlores allows Bernard and Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) to escape before committing suicide, blowing
        up a huge chunk of Incite headquarters along with several of Serac's allies.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        It doesn't look like we're just saying goodbye to Tommy Flanagan; as Dolores and co. arrive on a beach and
        <i>The Shining</i>'s intro music begins, Liam meets his fate when Ash denies Rehoboam's predictions by murdering
        him rather than stealing what little he has left. The unsettling music perfectly underscores a surprising
        revelation; right before he's shot, Liam hisses at Caleb that "you don't even know who you are" (much like
        Dolores to William), and we get some flashes to an earlier scene of Caleb pushing someone, only now we can see
        they've got a black bag over their head.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        As Liam lies on the beach and Caleb desperately tries to save him, recollecting Francis' similar death, we get
        several more flashes — a man in plastic cuffs, someone sitting in a chair with a black bag over their head, a
        scene in which he's strapped down to a hospital bed and screaming, and the waves that Caleb watched as he
        contemplated killing himself. Through his dying breaths, Liam repeatedly strains "you did it". "Who does he
        think I am?" Caleb asks, horrified. From what it seems, Caleb is one of the "aberrations" that goes against
        Rehoboam's order, so he was sent to war to be killed off. Who knows what he apparently did — my guess is he had
        more to do with Francis' death than he can remember. Maybe they keep him in rotation until he's no longer
        functional before wiping his memory and recycling him, just like a Delos host.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Whoever he is, it's all unclear besides his connection to Dolores. When he's delivered a mysterious package, he
        has no idea where it's from, and yet when a mysterious woman enters his life before overthrowing the whole world
        he knows exactly what's up. He has doubts, yes; perhaps people weren't meant to see their fates, and his desire
        to see his own is hardly indicative of humanity because he's a terribly inaccurate representation of the
        species. Dolores hesitates for a long moment — up until now, she hasn't said anything about who she is, but it's
        clear she will when, with bullet holes covering her abdomen, she confesses that she's not like the rest of them
        either. After a moment of thought, Fischerspooner's "Emerge" begins as Caleb chooses to ascend into the sky with
        Dolores, ready for a newcomer to turn his life around in lawless America; welcome back to Westworld.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Miscellaneous details:
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - This episode was directed by Anna Foerster and written by Karrie Crouse and Jonathan Nolan.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - No Tessa Thompson, Ed Harris, and Thandie Newton this week, but next week's episode apparently features the
        whole cast besides Aaron Paul — which, what? The teaser looks fantastic though.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - Alexandre Bar, the guy that plays young Serac, looks creepily like Vincent Cassel. Also, all the hand touching
        was kind of shot with uncomfortable intensity — I'll just say that the PDA did not immediately make it clear
        that Jean Mi was his brother.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - Liam complains that humans have already turned to their base selves while he wears a T-shirt that says "BASIC"
        in big, bold letters.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - Glad to see Aaron Paul and vincent Cassel actually doing stuff, but the music supervisors and Ramin Djawadi
        really carried this episode. Djawadi's Hitchcock piece and the string quartet rendition of "Space Oddity" were
        magnificent.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - The Incite compound Dempsey lands at looks exactly like <i>Westworld</i>. There's the Western landscape in the
        background, and all the data servers lined up look just like the wing of the main title sequence's eagle (so
        proud of myself for that catch). Furthermore, Inner Journeys Recovery's glass testing chambers look like both
        the Mesa and The Forge's testing facilities.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - Speaking of Inner Journeys Recovery, there's at least 36 of them based on the tablet Bernard reads. Tinlores
        sends him and Stubbs to check them out, which isn't surprising considering William was actually sent to one of
        those facilities in "The Mother of Exiles".
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - Well, I thought Pom Klementieff would actually become relevant considering her career skyrocketed with
        <i>Guardians of The Galaxy: Vol. 2</i>, but she just got murdered so bye I guess.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - Something one of the Doloreses said makes me very confident I know exactly what Dolores has done with the
        Valley Beyond's encryption key, but I think I'm actually right so I won't say anything just yet.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - Note that Serac begins the episode in the clouds, like God observing His creation. After being outwitted at
        several turns by Dolores, who actually dies in the process before confronting and dismissing Serac, she takes to
        the skies at the end of the episode and levels the playing field.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - My guess is that Tinlores' control unit is still completely intact, considering they shrug off point-blank
        bullet blasts. Curious what Serac will do with it, I'm certain it doesn't have the key he's looking for though.
        (I may be wrong, based on the teaser for next episode.)
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - The film <i>Love Story</i> does not end in happily-ever-after, and neither will any relationship between Caleb
        and Dolores. Remember that she sent Teddy to the Valley Beyond; if she wins this world, she's definitely
        bringing him back to her.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        - Next week’s episode is titled "Decoherence", directed by Jennifer Getzinger and written by Lisa Joy and
        Suzanne Wrubel. I frankly have no idea what it means, but Getzinger directed <i>Mad Men</i>'s "The Suitcase",
        which is probably my favorite episode from one of my favorite series.
