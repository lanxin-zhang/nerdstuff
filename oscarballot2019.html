        A predictable night at the Oscars pleasantly surprised when <i>Parasite</i> unprecedently won Best Director and Best Picture over <i>1917</i>. Considering my contemptuous opinion of most of the Academy's decisions, it was easily my favorite of their choices in recent years. However, for every Bong Joon-ho victory there was a <i>Joker</i> or <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> win, and <i>The Irishman</i> wound up the only Best Picture-nominated film that didn't win anything. The Oscars are supposed to honor great movies from around the world that actually push the medium forward, yet most of their choices encourage studios to make the same tired fare year after year. Annually, a couple of "brutally honest" voters explain their choices to the press, a worthwhile reminder that the vast majority of the voting body is actually just <i>really</i> stupid. In the spirit of creativity and innovation in the wake of a celebration of mediocrity and consistency, I feel obligated to share my own provocative choices for the Oscar line-up. If I was an Academy voter and not a teenage kid who's sorely missing some wisdom teeth, these are the films of 2019 that I would nominate, ranked preferentially in descending order.

          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            Cinematography is one of the key components of a great movie, yet it was nearly cut out of the Oscar telecast last year. Great job, Academy. To be fair, their nomination list was pretty good. Blaschke for <i>The Lighthouse</i> was a brilliant choice, and Deakins' excellence in framing Sam Mendes' <i>1917</i> was rightfully awarded the Oscar. Also deserving commendation are Rodrigo Pieto, Robert Richardson, Lawrence Sher, Yorick Le Saux (<i>Little Women</i>), Hong Kyung-Pyo (<i>Parasite</i>), and Hoyte van Hoytema (<i>Ad Astra</i>) for being fantastic as well. It's a shame none of them were recognized anywhere in a particularly competitive year.
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            Widmer's camera in <i>A Hidden Life</i> is one of the main reasons why the three-hour film with barely any plot is so enrapturing. Every scene looks breathtaking, typical of Malick's work, but the way that his camera moves around has so much spirit, so much grace, it is every bit as alive as the people it captures. Mathon's shots of <i>Portrait of A Lady On Fire</i>, the unbelievably beautiful beach and the unspoken tension between Haenel and Merlant, burn with passion. She also shot Mati Diop's ambitious <i>Atlantics</i>, another love story in separation with shockingly bold visuals. Her color timing is stunning, and her collaborations with directors Sciamma and Diop are elegantly staged.
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            Blaschke shot a black and white movie on 35mm film with a 1.19:1 aspect ratio, which in hindsight makes the Oscar nod much less surprising, but very few old school films could have eloquently visualized Willem Dafoe's semen dripping through a lighthouse floor. Just saying. The shades are sharp, distinct, perfectly suited to a film with a black sense of humor and an even bleaker sense of dread. I've gone back and forth endlessly on this last slot, because Le Saux, Sher, van Hoytema, and Hong all deserve recognition and I couldn't choose between them. So, I didn't. I don't think <i>Pain and Glory</i> has gotten any accolades for cinematography, but its frames are perfectly structured and its striking colors are so memorable. The way Alcaine shoots Asier Etxeandia performing the "Addiction" monologue? A ten.

          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            Ah, editing. Another vital component of cinema the Academy tried to cut out of its rapidly dying broadcast. Unlike cinematography, however, it's sometimes hard to pinpoint good editing. Bad editing is uncomfortably apparent, but good editing often slides under the radar. Unless your film is really flashy with its cuts like <i>Baby Driver</i> or <i>Ford v Ferrari</i>, editing nominations usually just correlate with Best Picture favorites. Yet somehow <i>1917</i> wasn't nominated, even though Smith stitched together dozens of scenes into a smooth "one-take". But they nominated it for Costume Design, which, yeah, but... huh? A shameful oversight, because <i>1917</i>'s technical achievement in creating its hellish warzone was phenomenal. Speaking of shameful choices, <i>Joker</i> and <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> have no business in this conversation. They were only nominated because the Academy loved them, which was already kind of questionable.
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            Both <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> and <i>Uncut Gems</i> had very obvious editing. However, <i>Uncut Gems</i>' editing sets the mood for the entire film, not just for a handful of car races. Every scene of Sandler's frantic flailing is subtly magnified with swift cuts that intensify the anxiety of his desperation. Another film whose editing is pretty noticeable is <i>Parasite</i>, which is very arguably the best of this pack. The peach montage sequence, the clash of the poor families, the "cricket scattering" as the Parks return, the freaky party massacre; it really is quite tempting to say <i>Parasite</i> was the best edited film of the year.
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            Schoonmaker makes a very strong counterargument: while <i>The Irishman</i> runs almost three and a half hours, time never drags in the movie. Hours and hours of footage seamlessly mesh together, letting its melancholy silently overwhelm the viewer. It's a perfect example of editing that manages to drive the narrative while taking a backseat to the film's grounded story. In my fifth slot is <i>Little Women</i>, whose cutting of past and present excellently complements Gerwig's story about the loss of childhood. It isn't as flashy as <i>Ford v Ferrari</i>, but it's much more effective in establishing the film's atmosphere. Also, the way Houy cuts in the middle of a scene to indicate a sudden tonal shift, which is often the case with Florence Pugh's Amy, is pretty damn clever.

            Other composers the Academy chose: Hildur Guðnadóttir - <i>Joker</i>, John Williams - <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i>
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            I haven't seen the latest <i>Star Wars</i> and all buzz surrounding it suggests that was a wise choice. Not losing sleep over ignoring that one. <i>Joker</i> had very good music, but Guðnadóttir's sombre tones were much better suited to the clinical <i>Chernobyl</i> than the emphatic <i>Joker</i>. This field is relatively competitive this year, even excluding my passion pick Max Richter, who I don't even think is eligible. Whatever, it's a hypothetical list. Richter scored Damon Lindelof's <i>The Leftovers</i>, one of my favorite TV shows, and his work on <i>Ad Astra</i> is every bit as beautifully depressing.
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            Both Newmans did great work too; while Thomas Newman's <i>1917</i> score is rightfully getting more praise for its consistent suspense, Randy Newman brings all the emotions to <i>Marriage Story</i>. Its warmth and compassion vibrantly colors Nicole and Charlie's happy moments, and its absence is painfully felt in their clashes. "The Belt of Faith" would be enough for Jung to win any other year, but my love for Desplat's <i>Little Women</i> soundtrack is incomparable. The bracing spirit of "Little Women", the elegant grace of "Amy", and the melodramatic "It's Romance" are simultaneously addictive music and vital components of Gerwig's storytelling. <i>Little Women</i> is practically a musical, and Desplat has countless showstopping tracks.

          <p class = "chicken">
            Along with <i>Parasite</i>'s shocking sweep, <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</i>'s production design win was one of the best choices on Oscar night. Every detail was plucked from a distinct memory: license plates on cars, fonts on signs, every tiny aspect of Hollywood's Golden Age was meticulously put together by Tarantino and brushed up with the golden hues of nostalgia. <i>The Irishman</i> might have been a better choice than <i>Little Women</i>, but having seen and hated the 1994 version of the film, everything in Gerwig's version was such an exponential improvement that contrast sends its achievements to the stars.
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            And speaking of the stars, of course, <i>Ad Astra</i> got little buzz for some remarkably innovative sci-fi sets. Though Gray rarely draws focus to them, there are planes to the Moon, Subway restaurants on the Moon, and Natasha Lyonne in a space station on Mars. Beat that. Which <i>Pain and Glory</i> totally did; Salvador's house is insanely cool, the bold colors complementing the costumes and cinematography while posters and paintings on the walls serve as inspirational demons of the past, pain and glory bundled up under one roof. However, the prize for best house goes to <i>Parasite</i>, whose sets were both gorgeous and set up some very crafty visual indicators about the story's dark direction. The staircases? Soo good, particularly the one that leads to the cellar which haunts all of my nightmares.

          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            Somehow, <i>Ad Astra</i> didn't make the shortlist while <i>Cats</i> did. Question mark. I know it's easy to just celebrate big effects that look cool, but just like editing, cinematography, and set design, the main job of VFX is to help tell a story. <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> largely uses effects for spectacle, which is admittedly necessary for the film's demographic, but though the film's VFX are much more polished than <i>The Irishman</i>'s, most of them serve as cheap thrills.
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            <i>The Lion King</i> utterly depends on its VFX and is much more successful than <i>The Irishman</i> in that regard (the first time young Robert De Niro was revealed was... jarring), but the lack of emotion in the animals' faces was a huge issue. <i>1917</i> got it right and was a perfect example of effectively using VFX, but as the space movie of the year that totally slaps, <i>Ad Astra</i> is the way to go. With space pirates, mutant baboons, and swaths of deep orange on a Mars station, the film's magnificence is only matched by its coldness. As great as it is to look at, the domination of negative space parallels Roy McBride's forsaken journey perfectly.

          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            I know snubbing Phoenix is supposed to be a big deal, but if it were up to me I'd go for Matthew Rhys (<i>A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood</i>) or Adam Sandler (<i>Uncut Gems</i>) first. Phoenix's technique is perfect, yes; he can cry and scream and cry out screams and scream while crying endlessly, but his role lacked the depth that so many lead male roles had in an extremely stacked year. Also, he made a mess of that abysmal scene when Arthur kills Murray; the writing was terrible, yes, but great acting should digsuise that, not make it nauseatingly apparent.
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            In a year when several actors had great roles in many movies, it stuns me that Scarlett Johansson was the sole double nominee. Pitt killed it in <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</i>, but he had much more challenging work in <i>Ad Astra</i>. His role as Roy McBride is extremely restrained, only letting little bits of emotion seep through until the floodgates open and he's pouring out decades of pent-up emotions. Pattinson's had a great indie career since <i>Twilight</i>, and <i>The Lighthouse</i> is a great example of how he's used his eccentric intensity to play some seriously messed up roles - the scene in which he gazes upon the light practically gave me a stroke. De Niro hasn't gotten any real credit for his role as Frank Sheeran in <i>The Irishman</i>, but he's at least as deserving of accolades as Pacino or Pesci. The scene when he tries to persuade Hoffa to stand down? Man's still got it.
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            Picking between Driver and Banderas is a tough call, but I feel like Banderas is so much better at filling in smaller moments than Driver. Driver can do the big screaming matches and the mental breakdowns, but Banderas' suppression of his emotions makes him much more real, much more alive than any other performer on this list. It's not like he can't deliver a big emotional scene, either: Salvador's reunion with Federico, the lost letter from Eduardo, Banderas is endlessly heartbreaking but he never goes over the top. It's a subtle but sincere performance, one that the Academy rarely recognizes but ranks among the best of the field.

          <p class = "chicken">
            What a weak category. I know the Academy was getting slammed for a lack of diversity, but did they really have to take the lame biopic route wih Erivo instead of commending Nyong'o on her best performance yet? Zellweger and Theron were equally lazy choices that paled in comparison to Elisabeth Moss' intense performance in <i>Her Smell</i>. Between Johansson and Moss, I wound up rooting for Johansson because <i>Marriage Story</i> is much better and she gets much better material. Moss is great, but she's pretty much jumping from 0% to 120% the entire time while Johansson gets to play everything in between.
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            Haenel's performance is the real standout of <i>Portrait of A Lady On Fire</i> as the true anchor of Sciamma's love story. Merlant gets the Kate Winslet reflections on a brief romance, but it's Haenel who makes those scenes sizzle, her mischievous eyes dancing before vigorously fighting off tears. Nyong'o gets more range, however, playing the vastly different Red and Adelaide. Red is a masterfully crafted nightmare and Adelaide is every bit as tough as Theron in <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>. Nyong'o makes Jordan Peele's slightly underwhelming second film a fascinating watch in spite of its flaws with a gritty performance whose tremendous risks spectacularly pay off.
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            The crown for scream queen of the year, however, belongs to Florence Pugh in a lovely floral arrangement. Her role as Dani is an exhausting and honest portrayal of grief, restraining her emotions before plunging into despair on a dime. Plus that last scene? Jesus. Of course, this race was fixed from the beginning because there was no way I wouldn't pick Saoirse Ronan as #1. Through <i>Brooklyn</i>, <i>Lady Bird</i>, and now <i>Little Women</i> she's always been my #1. A rare treasure, Ronan never looks like she's acting, even when her latest role is a drastic departure for her. She brings so much life and energy to the immensely talented cast; the camera truly loves Ronan, and her jaw-dropping confession of loneliness is maybe my favorite clip this year. Ronan's Jo and Haenel's Héloïse are awfully similar - both have a great running scene, have no interest in marriage, and accidentally catch their dresses on fire. As much as I love Haenel, though, Ronan always lights up the screen like no other actor from her generation can.

          <p class = "chicken">
            Outside of the Oscar nominee list in this category, there were few options. However, I'm of the mind the two omitted performances were better than any of the ones that actually got nominated. Nevertheless, praise to them as well: Pitt was a picture-perfect movie star who brought charisma and danger to one of Tarantino's best written roles, completely stealing the film from DiCaprio. Pacino is hilarious in <i>The Irishman</i> with countless great quips and comebacks, but I think Pesci overall gets the better material as Russell Bufalino. The "it's what it is" scene isn't by any means huge or obtusely loud, but Pesci's chilly stoicism in the film immediately makes his implied threat as dire as it should be. Hopkins and Hanks were also great, but Hopkins' material was too cliché and narrow while Hanks was outshone by Rhys. Neither of those movies was great either, to be honest.
          </p>

          <p class = "chicken">
            Dafoe was a major Oscar contender for <i>The Florida Project</i>, but the Academy clearly doesn't like him very much. Probably because he's always so damn creepy. In <i>The Lighthouse</i>, Dafoe brings classic Dafoe-creepy to an eleven while also being hilarious and totally frightening. The gaslighting scene with the ax was particularly crafty, and his brief performance as a sea god was grotesquely unforgettable. Loved him, but the year definitely belonged to Song Kang-ho in <i>Parasite</i>. To anyone who disagrees, you try selling an audience on a murder based solely on a dislike of bad smells. (A bit of an exaggeration, but you get what I mean.) He's funny and a little silly in the beginning, but Ki-taek's journey slowly guides us through the struggles of classism as he endures humiliation after humiliation with crumbling resolve. Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is the main character and his arc is pivotal to the story's conclusion, but the journey towards it is carried by Song's slowly unravelling performance, perfectly maintaining the tone of Bong's twisty narrative through brutal homicides and tuberculosis threats.

            Fight me on this, I dare you. It's not my fault all the ladies of <i>Parasite</i> filled this category, because this is one of the weakest acting categories I have lived to see. My god, the nominee list was dreadful. Robbie and Bates were great in one scene each, then vanished into the periphery with little to do. Johansson was good, but her accent sounded French and Waititi's writing really neutered her performance's potential. Dern was great in <i>Marriage Story</i>, but her role as Nora wasn't even as good as her <i>Little Women</i> performance as Marmee. Pugh was way ahead of this crowd with a brilliant performance that made Amy a fan favorite character, highlighting the charm of her troublemaking childhood and her profound maturity as a young woman. She carries herself gracefully, her physicality a picture of dignity and poise, and her intonation has the eloquence to match her appearance. She gave the best supporting performance of the year in my book, that's for sure.

            If we're actually celebrating performers and not just their films, however, the Academy should be recognizing multiple great performances from the same actor in the same category. If that were the case, Dern would wind up winning anyway. The "I'm angry nearly every day of my life" speech and the "virgin who gives birth" speech packaged into the marvel that is Laura Dern? Landslide. Also, I am glad that Dern is finally an Oscar winner because she got snubbed for <i>Inland Empire</i> after giving one of the defining performances of that decade. Even after David Lynch campaigned for her with a cow.

            Cho Yeo-jeong got the most buzz for the showiest performance in <i>Parasite</i>, which isn't surprising. She's ditzy and sexual in a Marilyn Monroe kind of way, and she gets all the big bursts of emotion. Lee also gets some great, big material, imitating North Korean broadcasters and delivering terrifying close-ups. Both actresses were phenomenal in their small parts, but the most interesting character to watch on screen was Ki-jung/Jessica, played perfectly by Park So-dam. Like Pitt in <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</i>, Park seems so cool without having to try at all. Her portrayal of a character portraying a character was the best, the "Jessica Jingle" was the second coming of the Wakanda greeting, and in the back half of the film she gets to show a lot of hidden vulnerability that makes her the most complex member of the Kim family, even if she's never a real focus in the film.

            Another terrible list, but at least I got rid of <i>Joker</i>. <i>The Two Popes</i> and <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> would never be here in a strong year, I just had to fill in space. <i>Toy Story 4</i> was great, and the way that the script used Bo Peep's return to pivot the franchise into a new direction was shrewd. Also, the digressions into maniacal violence from Key & Peele were great, as were Forky's struggles to jump into a trash can where he belongs. Relatable.

            I loved <i>The Irishman</i> dearly, but I'll have to admit I never read the source material. As well written as it is, I don't know how well Zaillian translated the book into a screenplay, while I am very aware of the incredible detail Gerwig put into <i>Little Women</i> that made the film better than both its predecessors and the original novel itself. Without any cramming, she introduced every big idea from the book into the play, twisting impossible plotlines like Jo's marriage to Bhaer into ingenius reflections of Alcott's similarities to her heroine Jo. It's a true translation from book to screen, a worthwhile lesson to all the bad biopics and remakes out there.

            Now, this was a viciously competitive category. <i>Parasite</i> is my favorite, because its story is totally insane but completely commits to realism while telling a crushing story about Korean poverty. Conceiving of a plot so absurd yet profound is some Hitchcock-level stuff. The runner-up is obviously Baumbach's <i>Marriage Story</i>, the writer-director's gift for writing dialogue being matched by few in the industry. Also, the film is much better plotted than some of his previous screenplays, which really works in its favor. The gradual rise of the lawyers that culminates in Nicole and Charlie's merciless fight is excellently orchestrated. <i>The Lighthouse</i> is twice as crazy as <i>Parasite</i> but not quite the Lynchian masterpiece it aspires to be; nevertheless, it's a fascinating piece of work with some dense themes beneath its dark waters.

            I loved <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</i>, but its emphatic grasp of the past lacked the focus and emotion of <i>Pain and Glory</i>. Every twist in Almodóvar's masterpiece is another moment of tears or exaltation, culminating in a beautiful catharsis that puts Tarantino's delightfully messy anti-climax to shame. The fifth slot belongs to Hogg's <i>The Souvenir</i>. The movie is a series of vignettes which quietly ramp up in horror and tension, something difficult to muster in such a seemingly harmless domestic drama. It may look like nothing, but the way it was written screams with emotion in even the quietest scenes, fantastic work that brings out the disturbing artistry of every day life.

            When it comes to the actual art of using a camera to tell stories, pretty much all of them are masters. Gerwig does amazing work on <i>Little Women</i>, but her impeccable writing has yet to be matched by her directing. She's terrific, but every frame of Sciamma's red-hot <i>Portrait</i> evokes her passion with a precision Gerwig has yet to perfect. Almodóvar's <i>Pain and Glory</i> is a rollercoaster of naked, emotional truth, and his stylized shots are excellently blocked and staged. The "Addiction" scene is particularly genius, but every shot of the film doesn't go to waste, blending all aspects of production into every frame to accentuate his semi-autobiographical drama. Malick holds together <i>A Hidden Life</i> with the sole strength of his magnificent visuals. His shots elevate nature, pain, struggle, and the common man to divine status, and I must say - it really is hard to complain about the face of God.

            As for Scorsese, must anything be said? The opening scene, emerging from the darkness as the sombre tones of "In The Still of The Night" commence, proves once again that he's one of the best directors working today. Bong was the real highlight of the season, though, because few directors manage to handle tone changes as smoothly as he does in <i>Parasite</i>. Slowly tiptoeing from a comedy of errors into a surrealist slasher, the technical aspects of <i>Parasite</i> hide dire warnings of the film's bleak ending while the cast's bubbly charm keeps a hold over the film's cheery illusion until the harsh reality of their situation takes over.

            Don't think this needs explaining, it's pretty much all above. Even though I wouldn't be able to choose between <i>Little Women</i> and <i>The Irishman</i>, I think it's clear which one needs more support. I will again commend the Academy for a fairly solid list of their own, in spite of several omissions I'm sure will end up in the history books. To corrupt a quote from <i>Little Women</i>: "Cinephiles will be bored of <i>Joker</i> and <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> in two years, but <i>Midsommar</i> and <i>The Souvenir</i> will be interesting forever!" And yet I'm fairly certain <i>Joker</i> will be widely praised forever, just because that would make me dream of death. Writing these lists helps me recognize what really went well in the industry last year, and what really didn't. Adaptations are obviously getting worse as Hollywood becomes more IP driven, but original content in 2019 was amazing. Also, a pretty bad year for acting in general. Besides Best Actor, the other fields had few competitors. In the coming year, I expect the qualitative dichotomy between adapted and original content to grow. However, considering a Nolan pic and a Spielberg remake of <i>West Side Story</i> are main headlines moving into 2020, it may be safer to say that both are heading straight for the trash bin. Your move, Forky.
