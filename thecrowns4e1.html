        [Spoilers for the season four premiere of <i>The Crown</i>, "Gold Stick"]
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Season premieres of <i>The Crown</i> have never been monumental episodes. They're solid
        episodes that reintroduce us to the royal family with a new seasonal arc in mind.
        That's perfectly fine, but like season three's "Olding" before it, there's a sort of
        ambivalence amidst all the drama as the show returns for its fourth season. Just like the plot
        where the Palace's art historian was secretly a Soviet spy, "Gold Stick" throws some 
        narrative curveballs that lack the momentum to really land. It's not for lack of trying by
        the cast and crew: O'Connor and Menzies are especially good in the episode, and newcomers
        Gillian Anderson and Emma Corrin as Thatcher and Diana immediately integrated themselves as invaluable
        members of <i>The Crown</i>'s formidable ensemble. Episode director Benjamin Caron 
        is perhaps the best television
        director right now, and the production quality is out of this world.
        However, <i>The Crown</i>'s very structure makes the episode's twist an incredibly hard sell.
    </p>

    <p class = "chicken">
        Dickie Mountbatten is a familiar character to the series, but he's only made a handful of notable appearances
        over the years. They weren't always endearing, either; the most prominent memory of him 
        I can think of is his attempted coup back in season three. His fatherly relationship with Charles
        was frequently discussed, but rarely shown before "Gold Stick": O'Connor's grieving performance
        is fantastic, but it's hard to share Charles' sentiments about Mountbatten's death. As I've said
        previously, <i>The Crown</i> is far too scattered to be a great serial drama. Mountbatten's assassination
        leading to Charles' courtship of Diana is a good idea, but it lacks impact without enough 
        context or investment in
        Charles' relationships with Camilla and Mountbatten. 
    </p>

    <p class ="chicken">    
        Of course, Morgan does try to remedy that issue
        with an egregiously expository monologue from Philip to Charles in which he helpfully explains
        (in extensive detail)
        both his and Charles' relationship with the father figure they shared. Tobias Menzies is 
        simply extraordinary, his casting being one of the best choices of the past two seasons;
        his tenuously vulnerable performance distracts from how obvious the writing is, and yet there's
        an intimidating edge in his tenderness. With his performance alone, Menzies
        implicitly explains Charles and Philip's difficulty connecting over the years. Philip has
        grown a great deal over the years, but he's still unwilling to accept that he might've been
        neglecting Charles like his own father neglected him. On the other hand, the writing—so frightfully
        afraid that the audience might miss its obvious message—only reinforces the fact Morgan
        isn't really suited to serial drama as Menzies parrots himself for minutes.
    </p>

    <p class ="chicken">
        Other aspects of the show compensate for Morgan's inconsistencies; Caron builds up
        to Mountbatten's assassination with frightfully anxious tension in the show's most overtly stylistic
        scene to date. Whether you've read up and know he's doomed or the IRA's threat is lingering in
        your mind, the threat of danger rises with heartpounding intensity as one of the family's
        three hunting parties becomes an unseen assailant's prey. The swift cuts between
        Charles, Mountbatten, and Anne—punctuated
        by the sharp sounds of chopping and gunfire—builds to a haunting climax as the Mountbatten boat
        erupts in flames. Charles' reaction to the news of his uncle's death is equally clever; meshed into the 
        scenery of a wide shot, the Prince of Wales howls with grief in a gorgeous meadow. A larger-than-life
        prince writ small, suffering Irish cruelty in a radiant Irish field, a miserable 
        and lonely man despite his idyllic surroundings; it's the perfect representation of Charles' pain.

    </p>

    <p class = "chicken">
        Caron handles the happier tones of the episode with equal excellence. The dreamy introduction
        of Charles and Diana is undeniably charming, and instantly unforgettable for the prince:
        even the future ruler of Britain doesn't often encounter a shy, mad tree from <i>A Midsummer Night's 
        Dream</i>. The scene is a classic meet-cute, but it doesn't forget to hammer in some key details
        that will lead the pair's relationship to ruin. For one, Charles is a middle-aged 
        artistic snob while Diana is a sixteen-year-old just trying to have a good time—he's looking for 
        a suitable queen, and she probably needs a date to the prom.
    </p>
    <p class ="chicken">
        On the other hand, Diana's naivety doesn't imply idiocy; she's
        committed to the idea of being with Charles and throws everything she has into it. 
        Emma Corrin seems effortlessly endearing as Diana, but the future Prince and Princess of
        Wales' whimsical first encounter is completely deliberate on her part.
        Fairytales aren't supposed to be strategic, they're moments of perfect serendipity; Cinderella
        doesn't plan on losing a glass slipper, it's just a stroke of luck that miraculously brings the prince back to her.
        The royal family—Dickie most of all—is desperate to construct some fairytale ending
        for Charles with Diana, but in his mind he's already found it with Camilla. Though everyone 
        will try to force
        Diana as a fit for Charles, herself included, chance inevitably triumphs over scheming
        in the laws of fairytales; try as she might to 
        the contrary, Diana will never be anything more than one of Cinderella's scheming step-sisters.
    </p>

    <p class = "chicken">
        On the subject of fairytale villains, Thatcher is elected as Britain's first woman Prime Minister.
        With two women in charge, everyone (without prompt) throws in their two cents:
        Philip and Thatcher's husband Denis doubt the efficacy of two women leading the country, Elizabeth
        argues the contrary, while Thatcher herself thinks that women are generally too emotional to
        hold positions of power. The first actual audience between the Queen and Prime Minister is, as
        expected, much more complicated than either of them expected. Elizabeth doesn't find
        a kindred spirit in Thatcher, and the Prime Minister, pleasantly satisfied for now, will find
        her own issues with the Queen quite soon. It's a solid introduction to an uncomfortable 
        dynamic between the two women that will continue throughout the season, and an impressive
        first appearance by Gillian Anderson. The voice is a bit excessive, almost as exaggerated as her
        massive wig, but otherwise it's a completely compelling transformation of one of TV's most
        recognizable stars. (Because of <i>The X-Files</i> for most people, but <i>Hannibal</i>
        for me. Love that show.)

    </p>

    <p class = "chicken">
        And... that's pretty much it for the episode. Not that other things don't happen: we simultaneously learn
        that Anne has married Mark Phillips and that their relationship has soured like milk. 
        Thatcher promises war against the IRA. Charles gets with countless girls, but finds their 
        lack of wedding rings to be disagreeable. Again,
        Menzies does some heavy lifting in the episode in a tender moment between Philip and 
        Anne (those two
        are probably my favorites now, especially since Charles is really starting to plummet), but the
        total lack of context surrounding almost every aspect of the episode leaves it a little
        lethargic. Besides its generally tepid exposition, the episode's key narrative point falls flat
        without a proper foundation. 
        With a literally explosive turn, "Gold Stick" should have propelled <i>The Crown</i>
        into its fourth season. Instead, it feels like 
        the show has started to exhaust itself; on a limp, the show trudges into its biggest season to date.
    </p>

    <p class = "chicken">
        Episode grade: 3/5
    </p>

    <p class="chicken">
        Miscellaneous details:
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — "Gold Stick" was directed by Benjamin Caron and written by Peter Morgan.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — The episode's title refers to a ceremonial position held by Lord Mountbatten as bodyguard to the monarch.
        It's rather fitting, since he spends the episode trying to save the monarchy by deterring
        Charles from Camilla.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — If the love story of Diana and Charles was set in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, I know exactly who would
        play the ass.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — Peter Morgan and Gillian Anderson were actually dating during this season, and broke up 
        after it released. Probably because he wouldn't stop making her character say that the country needed
        to change from top to bottom.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — That the show hates Thatcher was inevitable, but I didn't expect Morgan to go after her 
        so transparently: in the episode, she both declares women too emotional to be leaders (besides herself, of course)
        before then passionately declaring war on the IRA to a stoically grieving Elizabeth. If she's
        meant to be iron in any way, it's because she's brittle.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — The show can't stop underusing Erin Doherty's Anne, but they do include a scene where
        she argues with her husband in the car. Except we literally have no idea who he is at that point,
        and we never really will.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — Also, Anne is a showjumper! Cool tidbit, and her success compels Charles to stop
        being a glorious disappointment. 
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — Sarah Spencer desperately trying to steer Charles away from her sister was hilarious.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — Margaret's reaction to Elizabeth mistaking a girl with whiplash for a girl with a whip
        is brilliant.
      </p>

    <p class ="chicken">
        — The shots when Charles shows up to the Spencer house to see Diana are nearly identical
        with the ones when he goes to see Sarah; it's a clever visual cue that their relationship
        is equally doomed.
