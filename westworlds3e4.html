        [Spoilers for <i>Westworld</i> season three episode four, “The Mother of Exiles”]
      </p>
      <p class = "chicken">
        Just as it reached the midpoint of its season, <i>Westworld</i> dropped a massive bombshell: last week, Dolores was actually big spoon <i>and</i> little spoon. Oh yeah, and it turns out that Tessa Thompson is also playing Dolores. And so is Tommy Flanagan. And Hiroyuki Sanada is back! But not as Musashi; of course, he’s also Dolores. Major props to the craftiness of <i>Westworld</i>’s writing staff: it seemed plausible that Dolores had cloned herself into the Hale host, but I didn’t think they’d have the audacity to run with this. Like an over-achieving nerd in high school, it seems that Dolores chose to do her group project all by herself. From an acting standpoint, it’s wonderful. Jimmi Simpson and Ed Harris played the same character in season one, Evan Rachel Wood and Tessa Thompson played the same character in season two, and now we get to see four actors tackle the same role in season three. Narratively, it makes perfect sense for her to place her bets on herself for several reasons: she’s the most capable host, she’s the most trustworthy host, and she’s also only one host. We’ll probably learn more about Dolores’ choice to clone herself into four bodies later, but her decision might just be an altruistic one. Teddy and all of her other allies died trying to escape — this way, only she bears the consequences of her actions. Even more shocking than the big reveal is how quickly <i>Westworld</i> gave away the game while also leaping the plot forward on several Dolores-related fronts. Since I hate using “i” as a plural suffix, I’m going to call them the Doloreses, even though that word looks kind of weird. From henceforth, Hale/Dolores will again be known as Halores, Musashi/Dolores will be known as Mulores, and Martin/Dolores will be known as Tinlores because Malores sounds a lot like Mulores. And because tin is like robot. Anyway, the episode.

        After three episodes of absence, William (Ed Harris) makes a stunning return in this week’s cold open. Following his plunge into insanity last season, he wanders his home hearing voices and seeing people; though he screams his certainty that they’re fake, he shoots his own house aimlessly in an attempt to squash his visions. Harris’ return is a performative wonder, his portrayal of William as jarring as it is impressive. Devoid of the iron conviction of past seasons, he seems small and lost, helpless against visions of Emily (Katja Herbers) that mock his pathetic grip of his own identity. “I’ve always been in control”, he weakly insists while his daughter turns the tables on him, forcing him to question the nature of his own reality: “Are you free and evil? Or blameless and helplessly enslaved?” she asks. “Maybe you’re not even you. Would you even know if you’d been changed?” Again, William prepares to dig into his own wrist with his character profile (a grotesque symbol of self-destruction) to find the truth, but he’s interrupted by Hale (Tessa Thompson), who’s calling on him for help with the board. She’s apparently secured a wealthy investor who’s able to take Delos private, but it’ll take a lot of votes to make it happen. William has many, but not enough; it’ll take some persuasion from him to convince the other board members to back Hale. William isn’t pleased that she let a mole into the company under her watch, but since it turns out that he was the one who sold the data to Serac twenty years ago, not to mention that he really needs to get out more, he reluctantly agrees.

        Following the cold open, we take a quick look into Bernard’s (Jeffrey Wright) mind during Dolores’ (Evan Rachel Wood) reconstruction of him. They converse within a simulation of Arnold’s home, and he wonders which control units she brought into the real world with her. “You taught me that anything was possible. We could be whoever we want. Live however we want. Isn’t that what you believe?” she asks. Along with a past memory of Halores (Tessa Thompson) printing out control units, that’s in the back of his mind as he and Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) plot against Dolores in Victorville, USA. Considering how utterly ineffective they turn out to be, I actually really appreciate the levity of their scenes. They’re having a pretty peppy time compared to the Doloreses, which really explains why they’re so far behind at every step. Bernard assumes that Dolores’ study of Liam (John Gallagher Jr.) means he’s been killed and replaced by a host. He’s built a device that can freeze hosts on command, much like Serac’s in “The Winter Line”, and he plans to use it on the Liam host to find out which other hosts escaped before destroying him. Of course, Martin (Tommy Flanagan) is the host, not the trust fund dork who’s exploited out of his hash key by the masquerading robot. Though it isn’t clearly explained, a hash key seems to be a form of identification within the bloodstream that is accessed through fingerprint scanners. It’s passed onto Dolores, who takes Caleb (Aaron Paul) clothes shopping to teach him how to blend into high society. (Neat detail: the store can simulate how you’ll look in different outfits like you’re a video game character.) She proceeds to intercept Michael, a worker at Anderson Private Equity, and knock him out to steal some of his blood. It’s injected into Caleb (I hope we get some explanation about the safety of this later, because that’s gross), which is what allows him to pass through Anderson’s security as Michael Tritter. As they convince the “bank teller” to withdraw all of Liam’s funds, it’s clear that Dolores is clearly testing Caleb a lot this episode. She lets him do the persuasion all on his own, and he’s put under severe pressure when the hash key scanner is unable to process him due to his perspiration. He pulls through, saving him from taking any lives, something he’s clearly keen on never doing again. Picked the wrong camp, buddy.

        In Singapore, Serac (Vincent Cassel) awakens Maeve (Thandie Newton) to continue their conversation. We get a little bit of backstory about the mysterious trillionaire: he grew up in Paris with his brother, only to leave when an unexplained thermonuclear incident destroyed the city. To save humanity from itself, he built Rehoboam to understand humans and guide them away from more mistakes. However, his image of humanity was incomplete, because it didn’t account for the ways we hide from ourselves as we do others. Westworld’s success in completely mapping the human mind is the only model with which he can perfect his machine, but only Dolores knows where the data and the Valley Beyond really are. Serac takes Maeve to Arnold’s home, where an identity fixer named Jiang is being interrogated for information about Dolores. After being shown his family’s horrifying fate if Serac doesn’t intervene and save them, he confesses that he sent Dolores to “the Mortician” to receive five new identities. Serac promptly executes him for betraying his own kind, whether he knew it or not, and uses a back door he built into Maeve’s code to force her into compliance. They might have the same goal, Dolores, but it’s clear that Serac isn’t above controlling whoever he wants to in order to achieve what he wants. She’s dispatched to track down the Mortician; brilliant as she is, it takes her little time to find her and learn that Dolores bought the blood of Lara Espin (her alias in “Parce Domine”) for a new identity. Rather than get other blood samples for different identities, however, she was instead interested in smuggling corpses, which led her to the Yakuza.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        While Maeve nears one Dolores, Liam quickly approaches two. His friends Roderick (Rafi Gavron) and Penny (Phoebe Tonkin) from “Parce Domine” meet up with him, sympathetic about Lara’s overdose (yikes). Set to a gorgeous orchestral rendition of The Weeknd’s “Wicked Games”, they explore a masked auction of debauchery. I’m sure that it’ll draw plenty of comparisons to the famous orgy sequence in Stanley Kubrick’s <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, but it’s frankly a lot more like the opening party in the film than the orgy. Though they’re fundamentally parallel, the party streamlines the bestiality of desire into public high society by painting it with dignity and grace while tucking explicit vices into unseen underbellies. That description is perfect for the masked event, which in turn parallels Westworld in detail as well as principle. Liam’s proclaimed disinterest in prostitutes and Roderick’s dismissal that “all sex is commerce — if you don’t know that, you’re just being billed indirectly” is almost identical to Maeve’s quip to Teddy that “you're always paying for it, darling, The difference is, our costs are fixed and posted right there on the door”. Roderick is even English, and acts like a sleazier Lee Sizemore. Models pose, vulnerable and exposed for the appetites of the guests, while technicians operate terminals in front of them. Dolores is spot-on when she arrives with Caleb: “I thought your world would be so different from mine, but there isn’t any difference at all”. They quickly move into place while Bernard and Stubbs ambush Liam, trying to freeze and kidnap him. Of course, he isn’t a host, so they take him away at gunpoint while Martin gives Dolores the cue to intercept them. Caleb pursues the fleeing Bernard and Liam while Dolores beats down Stubbs in a spectacularly choreographed scene. With only one really functional arm, he’s easily subdued by her while Penny and Roderick watch. Obviously, she doesn’t consider them threats: drugged up on “genre”, Penny assumes she’s having a particularly potent hallucination while Roderick is left with a cute callback to the premiere. Bernard is tracked down by Caleb, who forces him to surrender Liam. The arrival of Martin alleviates Liam’s concerns, but his real identity bears no good news; he quickly eliminates the other security guards, sends Caleb to chase Liam into a trap, and confiscates Bernard’s freeze tool. Commenting on how they’ve waited for Bernard, Martin makes it clear that he never posed a real challenge for them. Bernard is confused — if he’s a host, then who is he?
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        As Dolores and Caleb zero in on Liam, Maeve clashes with the Yakuza on her trail to Dolores. Maeve’s superpowers were a huge advantage against enemy hosts in earlier seasons, and her connection with technology makes her even stronger in the real world. Considering our reliance on technology and the fact that she herself is a host, she’s able to easily hack security and turn the Yakuza’s auto-aim rifles against them. Wielding a katana and slicing her way through her enemies, she reunites with Musashi (Hiroyuki Sanada) from Shogun World. It’s nice at first, but something is deeply wrong — he draws a gun and kills the Mortician before deriding Maeve’s choices towards freedom, making it clear that the control unit within his head is not his own.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        At the same time, William attempts to conquer his hallucinations of Emily as he enters the shareholders meeting. He’s perfectly fine maintaining a facade of normalcy; we don’t see how the meeting goes but Hale is impressed, complimenting his skills before revealing she’s been listening to William’s ravings to his dead daughter this entire time. Mocking him for his deluded opinions of his own autonomy, Hale proclaims herself William’s oldest friend, and across three different storylines we see that Dolores didn’t bring the control units of her allies into the real world. No, she cloned herself three times over, because that’s the type of self-sufficient serial killer she is. Martin-Dolores (Tinlores) and Hale-Dolores (Halores) have been working to secure sufficient funds to secure Delos’ bid to go private, while Musashi-Dolores (Mulores) has been manufacturing host-building materials. Season two proved she was more capable than any of the other main characters, and here she proves it again. Tinlores defeats Bernard, forcing him into a car on its way to an unknown destination. Mulores engages in a glorious samurai fight with Maeve, stabbing her in the chest but leaving before her control unit can be extracted (the way this was staged was admittedly flawed, but ultimately irrelevant). William’s insanity is made common knowledge and he’s carted off to an institution, his votes to be given to the acting president Halores. As her various clones take down all her foes, Dolores gets exactly what she wanted: Caleb catches up to Liam and subdues him, letting her reunite with her brief flame. “Hello, lover”, she says with chilling apathy.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Main plot finished, we take a look at William in his mental institution, dressed completely in white. No longer a villain or a hero, he’s a shell of a man, pitiful and lost. Dolores emerges from the shadows in her blue Westworld dress, pleased with the small justice of his suffering and aggravating the frailty of his reality. Quivering, he meekly asks her the question that’s consumed his mind: “Am… I… me?”
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        “Welcome to the end of the game”, she says, giving him no peace before she disappears, leaving the small pale man alone with the towering shadows of his past.

        Miscellaneous details:
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - This episode was directed by previous series cinematographer Paul Cameron and written by “Les Écorchés” writer Jordan Goldberg and Lisa Joy.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Loved Katja Herbers’ guest appearance, hopefully she sticks around a little less from now on to bag that guest Emmy nomination.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - The name of the Yakuza’s base is “Itaidoshin Distillery” — “itai doshin” is a Buddhist principle that basically means “many in body, one is mind”.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - The scene where Serac looks at the eradicated Paris is strikingly similar to the young Dr. Ford and his dog Jock in Westworld. Hopefully we’ll get some elaboration on this.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - The Weeknd should’ve dominated season one’s score, his music is perfect for the show. He’s got the voice of an angel but the words of the devil, sweetly crooning about drugs and sex like they’re the principles of God.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        -  Clues about the Doloreses reveal below:<br>
        1. Hale says “William?” to wake him out of his reverie, but the voice belongs to Evan Rachel Wood.<br>
        2. Hale shaving William recalls Dolores doing the same thing in “The Bicameral Mind”. <br>
        3. Connells addresses Liam to Dolores as “our boyfriend”, and it isn’t because they dig polyamory.<br>
        4. “Itaidoshin” was a huge clue for select members of the audience.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Lots of recurring music this episode: “Freeze All Motor Functions”, “I Promise”, “Reverie”, “MIB”, and similar melodies played a lot throughout the episode.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Rehoboam has been tracking the hosts’ paths as divergences, but Serac doesn’t seem to know that some of them belong to Bernard. Guy needs to get a grip, because he has huge potential as an unknown variable right now.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Especially with the teller’s accent, Caleb’s alias “Michael Tritter” sounds a lot like “Michael Traitor”. Very cute, <i>Westworld</i>.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - When Maeve is fighting the Yakuza, white host goop leaks through barrels. It seems that Dolores is intent on manufacturing an army of her kind, but I’m going to guess she’s making more drone hosts to serve as her soldiers instead. More pliable, less emotional.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Sanada and Flanagan did quite well with the Dolores reveal. Their different takes on the same person really question what it is to be who you are: Thompson is easily my favorite Dolores clone, but maybe that’s because she’s a woman and her incarnation of Dolores plays the role most like the original.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Next week’s episode is titled “Genre”, directed by Anna Foerster and written by Karrie Crouse. Genre is the digital-psychopharma hybrid drug Roderick and Penny took that Liam was handed, which seems to feature heavily in next week’s episode with Caleb under the influence.
