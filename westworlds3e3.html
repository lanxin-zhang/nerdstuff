        [Spoilers for <i>Westworld</i> season three episode three, “The Absence of Field”]
      </p>
      <p class = "chicken">
        After two seasons, Tessa Thompson finally gets the showcase she deserves on this week's <i>Westworld</i>. Of course, Jeffrey Wright's brilliant question remains unanswered: "Who the Hale is she?" As is the norm with <i>Westworld</i>, "The Absence of Field" keeps that answer close to its chest while its ensemble delivers some jaw-dropping performances. We still don't know whose control units are within the Charlotte Hale and Martin Connells hosts, so I'll just be addressing them as Tessa Thompson and Tommy Flanagan for now. Bet for Martin is still Hector, Hale I'll get into later. This week's episode of <i>Westworld</i> is the first big narrative step for the season, setting the stage for various storylines to begin intersecting while devoting some valuable time to character development and worldbuilding. The pace of this season is admittedly slow — Ed Harris is finally making a debut next week — and this episode stands out from the previous two by finally placing some pieces together.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Let's start with Tessa Thompson's mysterious host. The episode opens with a little information about the real Charlotte Hale, who speaks to her son(!) Nathan after Dolores kills Dr. Ford (Anthony Hopkins). Months later, we observe someone else adopt her form; like a child coming into the world, she doesn't know where she is or who she is. "You're a creature of beauty and power", Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) says, commanding Thompson's host to calm down. What's interesting here is that Dolores clearly has affection for whoever Thompson is, but she has no qualms wielding administrative access over her.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        As she gradually begins remembering who she is, Dolores reveals that she's taken the form of Charlotte Hale and must infiltrate and lead Delos as interim CEO to continue host production. Judging by her reaction to the news, it's clear that Thompson's host was on Dolores' side and important enough to know who Hale was. Many signs point towards Thompson playing Teddy, but that seems too obvious to be true. Plus, it's shown that Bernard really was one of the other five pearls, so including Tommy Flanagan's host that means there's another two yet to be unveiled this season.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Flash forward to present time, and we can see Thompson begin unravelling as the weight of being someone else starts becoming too much for her. Last season, we saw how host bodies couldn't hold human control units, and this season we see the consequences of putting a brain full of memories and experiences into a completely different body. So much of who we are is defined by our appearances — there's a reason why Dolores continues to take her original form (besides the fact that Evan Rachel Wood is an incomparable gem). Thompson's character is hardly getting any relief; Hale's assistant Irene tells her that someone has secretly snapped up 38% of Delos' shares, making it impossible to go private. To make matters worse, there's a mole within the company who already gave the buyer a taste of data two decades ago.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        The pressure is not good for Thompson's host, whose body is clashing with her own mind. After living a corporate and domestic life while suppressing who she really is for so long, she's compelled to cut through herself to escape her own body, using her nails to tear through her own arm. It's horrifically gruesome, and her decaying reality has serious repercussions for the people around her. Hale's ex Jake criticizes her for forgetting to pick up Nathan yet again, and Thompson's host lets slip that she doesn't remember him staying at their apartment for eight years. She quickly tries to distract from that fact with sex (evidence this isn't Teddy or like, Dolores' dad ew), which works until her utter neglect of Nathan becomes even more apparent.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Whoever Thompson is playing, it's clear they want to be a good parent to the young boy. Unfortunately, it's hard trying to play the maternal part of Charlotte when all we knew of her was the icy businesswoman, and it's clear that Thompson's efforts aren't enough — her delivery of "go to sleep for your mommy" is disturbingly hollow, but not nearly as unnerving as Nathan's casual response that "you're not my mommy". Nathan Hale was an American spy in the American Revolutionary War, and his mother was Elizabeth Hale; the revelation that Elizabeth is Charlotte's middle name is a nod to both Thompson's host being a spy and a later reference to Hale herself, but it might also be a warning that Nathan rats her out.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Thankfully, not many others know about Hale's soft side, allowing Thompson's host to pass by without detection. After slicing her arm yet again, it's revealed by Irene that a mysterious man named Serac (Vincent Cassel), a certified trillionaire and the richest man in the world, is the one responsible for buying all the Delos stock. There don't seem to be many moves left for Team Robot; completely isolated from Dolores and lost in a persona, Thompson's character quickly plunges into darkness.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Of course, Dolores herself has been quite busy. Caleb (Aaron Paul) holds onto the dying host as an ambulance arrives, but they aren't able to offer much assistance. In the future, it seems that machines diagnose and prescribe patients treatments on the spot. Since Dolores is a host, her blood doesn't have any platelets, rendering them useless. Caleb recognizes that she's running out of blood and tranfuses her some — human or not, it does the trick, but not before some cops pull them over. Caleb quickly realizes they're only posing as cops on a mission to kill Dolores, and does his best to defend her from two heavily armed men.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        The parademics are slaughtered, and Caleb is only able to stop one of two men after Dolores. In a poor twist for him, the blood does its trick and she wakes up more menacing than ever. Wood is particularly great in these action scenes; in spite of their spectacular nature, her terrifying performance elevates the otherwise standard action sequences to bone-chilling terror. The deathly look in her eyes as she stabs her assassin's throat is as masterful as it is frightening. After neatly executing her assailants, she gets Caleb's full name before driving away with the impression that they'll never meet again. Of course they do, but Dolores has other problems to deal with at the moment.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Thompson's host faces more troubles when Delos board members tell her that several control units are missing from the park, including Maeve Millay's (Thandie Newton). Things are rapidly escalating: the spy must be found, the control units must be found, Thompson must do her best to maintain her own facade, and she keeps getting mysterious messages that just sound like static. It's all becoming too much, and Thompson's host breaks and calls Dolores for help. When they meet at a hotel, it's clear just how badly Thompson is falling apart; she publicly pulls back her sleeve to reveal a deep incision running up her arm. "I feel like I'm changing", she says. "What the fuck is happening to me?!"
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        In order to prevent a scene, Dolores forcefully turns off her emotional affect before taking them upstairs. In this sequence, it's interesting to note that Thompson's host now has a mole on her left cheek; the meaning is ambiguous, but I'd venture that it's her own way of distinguishing herself from Charlotte Hale herself. No matter who is in Hale, they're fearful enough of Dolores to consider they're about to die. Thankfully, it doesn't come to that. Dolores successfully calms down Thompson's host with surprising tenderness — since she's always killing and manipulating others, it's hard to remember the softness beneath her iron exterior. "No one knows you like I do. No one knows me like you", she says to Thompson's host, another clue as to who she might be.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Seeing the extent of Thompson's cuts, which look like keys (the circles look like Rehoboam's divergences), Dolores notes that "Hale was always ruthless. A predator," and that Thompson's character might be adopting too much of the role she's playing. Thompson informs Dolores that Serac is behind the Delos takeover, chasing after them even as they chase him. In order to stop him from taking control of Delos, Dolores tells her to destroy the spy and meet an "old friend" with enough resources to present a counteroffer to the board; just like that, William (Ed Harris) is about to return to the game. Unless I'm wrong, but the guy is rich as hell so I doubt it. Plans made, the two hosts share a sweet moment of cuddling that resembles Teddy (James Marsden) and Dolores in "The Passenger". Still, I'm banking on that being a red herring.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Meanwhile, Caleb and Dolores get the opportunity for a real meet-cute when he's apprehended at his mother's hospital by some of his old RICO co-workers. Luckily, his abduction coincides with Dolores' request to Tommy Flanagan's host for some data on Caleb. Seeing surveillance tapes of the kidnapping, Dolores prepares for an observation. Flanagan is then dispatched to speak to Liam to gather any intel he can on Serac; Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) and Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) were just headed to find Liam, so it looks like some major collisions are happening next week.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Caleb himself is threatened with some major collisions, being held over a ledge and interrogated for information about Dolores. He refuses, so his captors activate his "drip", a metal contraption on the roof of his mouth he got in the army that allows him to be controlled from a terminal like a host. One of the men uses it to turn up his heartbeat to a dangerous pace, causing Caleb's robot coworker pal George to awaken and ascend the stairs to help. Unfortunately, George isn't programmed to fight humans and is tossed off the building, which recalls dark memories of the sea for Caleb. Why? It isn't immediately apparent, especially since Dolores emerges and kills both of his captors. Caleb surprises her by not giving her up, so she saves his life; it's a nice re-introduction, and she even reveals her name to him. "Nice to finally meet you", he says. Guy has no idea. Dolores retrieves Incite's information about Caleb from Flanagan's host, and readies her devastating sales pitch.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Back to Tessa Thompson, who doesn't get any information on the mole but does receive the tape of Charlotte Hale speaking to her son. Tears streaming down her face, Hale sings her and Nathan's special song, "You Are My Sunshine". It's more emotion than we've ever seen from her, and it further distracts Thompson's host from the fact that she's late yet again to pick up Nathan. On her way to the school park, she receives another static phone call with a sharp dial tone whose meaning is still ambiguous. Thompson finds Nathan with Tommy, previously assumed by her to be a young boy, who's actually a grown man whose intentions are anything but ambiguous.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        While Tommy only caresses Nathan's hand as he pets a dog (the innuendo is not lost here), the warning is clear to Thompson; her actions are putting Nathan in danger, so she finally takes action to look after him. Of course, not as a traditional mother: in a horribly brutal sequence, she chokes the life out of him while delivering her most haunting monologue to date. "The harder I squeeze, the more I remember — I remember what it's like to be me", she whispers. "You're not the only predator here." And because she's well-versed in the ways of retribution, she takes Tommy's dog along with his life, bringing it to Nathan as a gift. "You are my sunshine", she says, with newfound commitment to her role.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Her assumption of Hale's position while retaining her own identity has been made easier by some cathartic murder, but it does leave some questions open. Considering the complexity of identity in Thompson's case, when she says she remembers what it's like to ber herself, does she mean her real self or Charlotte Hale? It would seem she means her own self, but she declared herself a predator like Hale was. It seems to me that she's beginning to identify too much with Charlotte's malicious instincts, and the innocence we saw at the beginning of the episode will soon be corrupted beyond repair.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Caleb, on the other hand, has been beyond repair for decades. Dolores reveals she knows that he comes to a specific diner annually and orders the same specific meal, recalling the time his mother abandoned him there. Every detail was recorded by Rehoboam before any privacy laws existed: the entire conversation he had with the waiter, Sara, is listed, completely freezing his most traumatic memory in time. Caleb is furious already, but Dolores' demonstration is far from done. Just like the hosts, he needs a little more suffering and self-realization to break free.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        She takes him onto a pier, not because he had his first drink there, but because it's the site of his suicide within ten to twelve years. Incite does much more than collect data; it aggregates all the information it gets to create an artificial mirror world that determines potential possibilities for everyone. Given his dark past, no companies are interested in hiring him out of conviction his depression will make him a poor investment, and yet by following Incite's projections they twist them into self-fulfilling prophecies. He's every bit as trapped as one of the hosts, but he's a mere mortal whose fate seems unchangeable. The flashbacks of the waves reflected the very suicide the system predicted; there's no life left for Caleb if he continues down his current path, so he fully commits to Dolores' cause. And what is that cause? To "show this world for what it really is", to destroy Rehoboam and free humanity just like she did the hosts.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        As Caleb learns the truth about his own reality, Thompson's host learns a few shocking things about the person whose body she inhabits. Watching Hale sing "You Are My Sunshine", a brilliant acting piece in which Thompson silently emotes and we listen to a solely auditory performance, she realizes the dial tones she's been receiving correspond with the melody of the song. Thompson's host has been searching for the mole, but it's actually <i>her</i>. After successfully calling the mysterious number back by using the tones as a password, her self-driving car suddenly changes directions and takes her to Serac's mansion. Pom Klementieff returns to give her some AR glasses, and she speaks to a frustrated Serac who demands she locate the missing data that Dolores beamed into an unknown location.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        The interaction is complex: it seems Serac doesn't know Thompson's character is a host, but she also only interacts with a hologram of him. The extent of trust between the two characters is unclear, and Thompson's lack of knowledge about their previous encounters doesn't help. Furthermore, there must've been someone else on the inside who took Maeve's control unit, someone besides Charlotte Hale: "you don't think that you're the only person under my control?" Serac smugly asks. She promises that they're searching for the data, and Serac coldly tells her that time is running out for her as "Doomed" by Moses Sumney croons through the credits. After pretending to be an old foe and spying on a whole company, it seems that Thompson must also now pretend to be an ally of yet another enemy and his very own monstrous company. It's a classic <i>Westworld</i> headspinner, and if "The Absence of Field" is any indication, its insanity is a great look for television's strongest ensemble.

        Miscellaneous details:
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - This episode was directed by Amanda Marsalis and written by <i>Person of Interest</i> writer Denise Thé.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Who the Hale is she? I'm betting on Angela. I know she blew up during "Les Écorchés", but control units have survived blasts to the skull. She's close to Dolores, she can be vicious when necessary, and she has no problems with weaponizing sex. Clementine and Dolores' father had totally messed up control units, and Teddy was sent into the Valley. Granted, they could've been reconstructed from memory, but I think it's more likely to be Angela. If it's not her, then it's probable that Dolores has cloned herself and she's in both Evan Rachel Wood and Tessa Thompson's bodies.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - On this week of robots apparently calling out humanity but really just launching personal attacks at me, Dolores tells Thompson's host that she's acting like a human because she can't control her impulses. FYI, Dolores, I'm living through a global pandemic; 5000 mg of sodium a day is hardly an id-driven decision at this point.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - The title of the episode comes from a couple of lines from Mark Strand's poem "Keeping Things Whole": "In a field / I am the absence / of field. / This is / always the case. / Wherever I am / I am what is missing.” Obviously, this is Serac, who is also described as a black hole, an emptiness whose presence can only be inferred by the absence of anything. Of course, it also applies to Thompson's host, an impostor whose presence is indicative of what's missing — the real Hale. Her facade will come crashing down soon enough, and it will be awful for poor Nathan.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Speaking of Nathan, there is clearly something fishy about him: his pillowcase design has the arrows that are part of season three's main title sequence, which represent Rehoboam. Considering his name as well, something's going to go very wrong soon.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        -  On the topic of sketchy Hale stuff, the recording isn't the same the second time we see/hear it. Maybe it's because it's cut differently, but maybe it's because of something else? Can't figure out what.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Actually, maybe I can. There's a possibility some of this season takes place in Rehoboam's artificial mirror world, which  might explain why Hale's recording is different the second time — only one is the real deal.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - I wasn't going to address anagrams, but apparently Joy and Nolan have taken well to observations that Bernard's alias Armand Delgado is an anagram of Damaged Arnold. Don't know what to make of that, but Caleb Nichols is almost an anagram of Silicon Beach, which looks to be the place where he's projected to end his own life. In another twist of fate, Dolores Abernathy is an anagram for "Hoe Betrays Arnold". Hardly a good joke, but I'm always pleased by what the internet drudges up for fun.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - No Jeffrey Wright, Ed Harris, or Thandie Newton this episode, but it looks like they'll all be appearing in next week's episode.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Details from Caleb's Incite profile: he graduated high school on June 5, 2042, enlisted into the army on December 22, 2042, was shot in the head (likely what he referenced in "Parce Domine") on May 9, 2048, and witnessed Francis (Kid Cudi) die on April 4, 2049. Not only does the system suggest he shouldn't marry or have kids, it actually intervened to end one of his relationships on October 2, 2055.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - All the elephants in the future are dead. :(
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Next week’s episode is titled “The Mother of Exiles", directed by Paul Cameron and written by Jordan Goldberg and Lisa Joy. Paul Cameron shot the pilot (and was Emmy-nominated for it) as well as this season's premiere "Parce Domine", and now he's returning as a director. Jordan Goldberg previously co-wrote "Les Écorchés" with Ron Fitzgerald last season, and Lisa Joy is awesome. The title of the episode refers to the Statue of Liberty, and its tagline is "the truth doesn't always set you free". Someone better let Dolores know.
