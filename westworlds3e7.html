        [Spoilers for <i>Westworld</i> season three episode seven, "Passed Pawn"]
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        With only one episode left to go, <i>Westworld</i> has seriously begun tying things together. However, the lack
        of focus on Bernard, Maeve, William, and Charlores has left the series with a lot of loose ends that might make
        for a messy season finale. On next week's episode, Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan's sci-fi epic will be forced to
        wrap a season in which the entire world has fallen into chaos and Jeffrey Wright has fallen so far down my Emmy
        prediction list that Luke Hemsworth is probably above him. Aaron Paul was absolutely fantastic this week though,
        and the episode left a lot on the table for a huge finale. And even if that sucks, season four has been
        officially greenlit! So they'll have another go at it. Even its worst moments, the show remains one of the most
        challenging and complex series on TV.
      </p>


      <p class="chicken">
        "Passed Pawn" begins in Jakarta with Mulores (Hiroyuki Sanada) sending off a briefcase to a friend, presumably
        Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood). It's not the bag that Caleb receives at the end of "Genre", so who knows what it
        contains. Our time with Hiroyuki Sanada is sadly cut short when a healing Charlores (Tessa Thompson) calls to
        reveal that she's turned on Dolores and intends to streamline operations for a new plan. Charlores has leaked
        Mulores' location to Serac (Vincent Cassel) for this mysterious scheme, who sends Clementine (Angela Sarafyan)
        to capture the sadly-underused Yakuza Dolores. I'm sort of disappointed by how casually the show treats the
        return of Clementine considering the suspense they built towards it last week, but it's always good to see
        Sarafyan.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Another thing about the season that's been shaky is Maeve's commitment to Serac, and Mulores voices out my own
        opinion when he tells Clementine that "you and Maeve have had some practice selling yourselves, but I thought
        you'd be more selective about your buyer". It's a cruel insult, one that he pays for when Shogun World's Hanaryo
        (Tao Okamoto) returns to help Clementine kill him and leave with his corpse, but Mulores does bring up a good
        point. How much does Clementine even know about Serac, and why is she choosing to help him? Why is Maeve? Even
        dead, though, Mulores has been relatively undisturbed this entire time and his plans are already underway.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Dolores' own plan for humanity, particularly Caleb, completely comes into focus in this episode. Throughout the
        episode, Caleb (Aaron Paul) has flashbacks to key moments in his past like the mysterious kidnapping ones from
        "Genre", underscored by a Dr. Greene telling him to "start at the beginning" of his story. Caleb says he has
        trouble remembering what happened to him, but he does remember Francis (Kid Cudi) was killed; when asked who his
        killer was, we cut away. At this point, it's pretty clear Caleb was responsible, but the show plays along with
        his ignorance as the story unfolds.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        In Sonora, Mexico, Dolores and Caleb ride horses through gorgeous scenery that perfectly recalls Westworld
        itself, which is intentional — in fact, the park design was based on Sonora. Finally, Caleb confronts Dolores
        about her identity, having deduced she's a host that escaped Westworld (did they talk about anything at all on
        the plane ride?). She doesn't deny it, or twist his questions about the morality of her actions. Instead, with
        surprising emotion, she reveals her ultimate goal for both hosts and humans. "I want a place for my kind and for
        all of us to be free", she says. "My kind is all but extinct thanks to Serac, but people still have a chance.
        They'll need someone to lead them".
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Dolores has been in murder-mode rather often this season, so her plan is impressively generous to everyone. Or
        maybe she's just tricking Caleb, too? She also tells him she drastically changed from a rancher's daughter to
        something much bigger in order to survive. At this point, it's still hard to discern if we can trust Dolores and
        her proclaimed mission. When Caleb asks her how many people must die for her revolution, she genuinely looks
        conflicted about the lives she'll have to take. On the other hand, we've witnessed Dolores' transformation
        between the first two seasons in order to survive, and in season three we've seen her manipulate countless
        humans. Whether she's actually being honest or not, Caleb buys enough of it to continue with her to...
        somewhere.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        That "somewhere" turns out to be another Inner Journeys Recovery facility in Sonara, the location courtesy of
        William (Ed Harris). After Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) and Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) found him in "Decoherence",
        they've been a begrudging trio of mistrust. William learns Stubbs is also a host ("Fucking Ford" is perfectly
        delivered by Harris), while Bernard learns that the tracker Charlores put into William in "The Mother of Exiles"
        also allowed her to enter the system and locate the Inner Journeys Recovery where Serac reconditioned his own
        brother. And as good things come in threes, Bernard also learns that William is apparently dead. Whaaat?
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Equally mind-boggling are Caleb's recurring memories—as we hear Dr. Greene's "start at the beginning" again (the
        repetition reminiscent of Dolores in "The Original" and Maeve in "Chestnut") and Caleb reflect that "sometimes,
        I think I never really had a choice", we cut to him in Crimea during the Second Russian Civil War. He was part
        of the US force secretly employed to kill insurgents (a hint of what's to come later), and had specific glasses
        that tracked their targets. A spoonful of sugar helps all the murder go down, so Caleb and his fellow soldiers
        frequently placed the Eucharist-shaped "limbics" on their tongues (no chewing!) to numb their emotions and get
        on with the killing.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        After Caleb and his allies send the signal for missiles to strike down the insurgents, they realize they've been
        tracked themselves — a missile blows up in front of Caleb, nearly killing him. Caleb says the attackers were
        Russian insurgents, and that he and Francis kidnapped their leader — the man with the bag over his head in
        "Genre". Starting to make sense, right? But Dr. Greene tells him to "start at the beginning" yet again, in a
        stark white room with AR glasses. Obviously, he's spent more than his fair share of time at Inner Journeys
        Recovery.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Caleb starts to remember what happened to him when he and Dolores approach the compound. With a nifty drone from
        the bag Caleb received in "Genre", she easily clears out the facility's guards and they enter. Interestingly,
        Dolores knows exactly how he's going to react as he slowly recalls his time at the reconditioning facility.
        Clearly, she's had the entire affair planned from "The Absence of Field" at the very latest. Caleb starts to get
        freaked out as old memories surface, but Dolores tells him to push through while they look for Solomon,
        Rehoboam's predecessor.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        It turns out that the previous iteration of Rehoboam, Solomon, basically became an insane AI that didn't fit
        Serac's plans. A military grade EMP stands by in case he tries to digitally escape the building. Solomon is
        brought to life by Dolores and Caleb, and after some robot bickering she asks him to alter Serac's plan, which
        wasn't able to deal with outliers (including Jean Mi and Solomon itself). Solomon says that reconditioning
        therapy has proven effective sometimes for fixing outliers, citing Caleb as "one of the first" that was
        successfully treated. Aggravated as he is by more flashes of his suppressed memories, Caleb's actually one of
        the lucky ones — only 10% of patients are successfully reconditioned.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Simultaneously, Bernard learns the truth of the reconditioning therapy at the other Inner Journeys Recovery
        building. William proudly tells Bernard that he was the one that gave Serac the biometric data necessary for
        reconditioning, which is not a great look for a supposed "bastion of society". Bernard is obviously angry, but
        there's nothing he can do besides track down the outliers Dolores was looking for. Stubbs pores through Inner
        Journey Recovery's database to find out that Caleb is one of the remaining outliers, most of them being missing
        or dead. Considering they're sent off to war, that's hardly surprising — another flashback shows Caleb
        kidnapping the Russian insurgent with Francis and getting ambushed when the evac team doesn't show up. Caleb
        kills them all, including the insurgent leader Whitman, but Francis dies in the process.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        That's the official version in Caleb's head as he and Dolores track down Solomon's source. A random hologram
        appears of Serac (Dolores' surprise as brief as it is rare), greeting his brother Jean Mi in the case that he's
        welcome back into society. Why is the message delivered halfway through a staircase? Because on the other end is
        humanity's very own cold storage, rows and rows of cryogenic chambers containing unchangeable outliers. And
        arguably, they're actually the lucky ones — Solomon reveals that Caleb was actually tasked with hunting down
        other outliers, insurgents, and that RICO was made by Incite to regulate criminality for that purpose.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        The truth grossly perverts Caleb's melancholic memories of his dead friend. Francis actually survived the war
        with Caleb, but the two only got by using RICO to support themselves and spice up their miserable and dull
        lives. Tasked with kidnap and ransom, the pair abduct the "Russian Insurgent Leader" Whitman. Incite's
        military-grade limbics and reconditioning dissociate memories (think Bernard in season two), making it hard for
        Caleb to remember what he really did. The same kidnapping scene plays out as Caleb takes the bag off Whitman's
        head, but this time he reveals to Caleb that he represents the company that designed their limbics. The RICO
        assignment is a lie: he knows he's either about to go under forever or die.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        On the cusp of total recollection, Caleb struggles to keep it together, giving us Aaron Paul's best work the
        whole season. His enlightening reverie is interrupted by the incoming Maeve (Thandie Newton), who steps off a
        helicopter with a katana (great look, but horribly impractical). Quickly, Dolores tells Solomon to run a plan
        that protects everyone, the one Jean Mi developed fifteen years ago before he and Solomon were tossed aside.
        Most of all, she asks that Solomon adapt Jean Mi's future to include Caleb, the passed pawn she hopes will save
        the world. The whole thing is actually quite touching: Dolores prepares to be killed by Maeve in order to give
        Solomon and Caleb time to save at least one intelligent species.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        The rest is kinda weird. Maeve, speaking through Dolores' implant, is obviously furious after Charlores killed
        Hector, but I'm still confused why she thinks the Forge data and The Valley Beyond would be safer with Serac
        than Dolores. Their resulting argument goes around the same circle it did in "Decoherence", but with much more
        malice — the fight begins when one of the facility robots literally stabs Dolores in the back. When Dolores and
        Maeve actually clash, the fight scene is actually great. The stunts are excellent (Evan Rachel Wood being a tae
        kwon do black belt is likely a plus), and the move where Dolores pushes Maeve's face before slamming a fist into
        her gut is a great example of the hosts' divergence from human combat styles (or at the very least, their
        Western roots).
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Things are not going well for Bernard and co. either, whose plans drastically diverge the second they leave
        Inner Journeys Recovery. William declares that his biggest mistake was helping build the hosts and the parks,
        promising to kill all of them if they don't kill him first. Chilling stuff, but Bernard decides to keep him
        around in case he becomes useful later. How, I don't know, but it's clearly a bad choice because William finds a
        weapon to kill them the second they let him out of their sight. Shocker. It's a shame, because if he kills them
        (along with Jeffrey Wright's Emmy odds) he won't be privy to Bernard's suspicions. Doubtful of Dolores as usual,
        Bernard believes she's really just using Caleb as a tool to destroy humanity, again throwing her motivations
        into question.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        What Caleb intends to do is also unclear. After being warned by Solomon that assisting Dolores is dangerous, his
        backstory is finally revealed to both him and the audience. It turns out that while Francis scouted the
        perimeter, Whitman revealed to Caleb that he knew the RICO mission was abnormal and that Caleb and Francis would
        each soon receive jobs to kill the other, ridding the world of more outliers. Caleb refused to believe it, but
        when Francis returned he insisted they leave before backup arrived. When they all gathered outside, Caleb
        realized that Whitman was right — there was a target on his back. "How much?" he asked. When the request to kill
        Francis appeared on Caleb's device, Francis finally responded: "enough".
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Of course, talking instead of killing is a bad idea, and Francis gets shot before he gets the draw on Caleb. In
        his grief, he kills the apathetic Whitman too, setting the stage for his adulterated memories to take over.
        Furious, Caleb realizes Solomon used him as a hitman and turned him against his friends to maintain the peace of
        others, but he can do nothing but accept Solomon's new plan for revolution. It's the least he can do for
        Dolores, whose fight with Maeve takes a nasty turn. Both bring some robot friends; Maeve has a helicopter, and
        Dolores has her tripod rifle from earlier in the episode.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        It's easy to guess whose is better when Dolores gets stabbed in the gut before the helicopter blasts off her
        arm. "Passed Pawn" is definitely Aaron Paul's best episode yet, but it's a great showcase for Wood too, who also
        delivers her widest range of emotions in the season. She crawls into the facility with the ferocious
        determination of a rabid animal, and at the last moment she activates the EMP to shut down both Maeve and
        herself. It also turns off Solomon, who was just telling Caleb to take a drive with enough information to kill
        Serac and stop his plan. He's about to warn Caleb about something, but he powers off as well. Like Ford, Dolores
        dies to reveal the truth of a species to a bit player, empowering them to revolutionize the world. Armed with
        godly knowledge and his whole history, Caleb the passed pawn becomes the strongest piece on the board — who
        knows what his next move will be.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Miscellaneous details:
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – This episode was directed by Helen Shaver and written by Gina Atwater, who wrote season two's "The Riddle of
        The Sphinx" and serves as a staff writer.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – The abysmal firearms aim on this show could've previously been attributed to human idiocy, but when Mulores
        empties magazines into the air after Charlores sniped down a security team last week, there really is no excuse
        left. Pull it together, <i>Westworld</i>.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – Since we've only one episode left and I feel pretty confident about the finale having a cold open, it's worth
        mentioning how the first season had no cold opens, the second had a couple, and the entire third season has
        them. For me, it's an indication of the show's shift from niche prestige to more mainstream TV (which makes the
        show's diminishing viewership rather ironic).
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – There's a sign saying "Lab to Slab" advertising artificial meat — where is the show's production design Emmy?
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – Finally an attack on humanity that doesn't apply to me, but likely will when I eventually sell out: "every
        human relationship can be adjusted with the right amount of money".
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – William's patient ID looks identical to Caleb's. No idea what that could mean, and there's the possibility one
        of the I's is a 1 and I'm mistaken but still.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – Clementine's post-murder hair flip is magnificent, and it's great seeing Sarafyan and Okamoto in the main
        titles.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – The episode's tagline is "A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out". I guess that's Caleb, but I doubt he'll be chummy for long. 
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – "Don't lecture me, you fucking can opener!"
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – Solomon is made of triangles because he's chaotic, while Rehoboam has smooth straight rings because he's
        perfectly ordered.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – When Caleb believes himself to be killing Russian insurgents the graffiti in the background is Russian, but
        when he realizes he killed Whitman in America the graffiti is all in English.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – William saying Bernard isn't Arnold is interesting in a season where individual identity is particularly under
        fire, and it's a real shame we didn't get more screentime to explore the Dolores/Wyatt dichotomy, Charlores'
        identity crisis, and Bernard/Arnold's meshed identity.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – Dolores being roasted by Solomon and her amusement with Serac's naming style are a clever and meta way of
        addressing criticism's of the show's dialogue, which ranges from bizarre to brilliant every week. Also, Solomon
        saying "if this is indeed now, and we are indeed here" and the smirk it prompts from Dolores are either a
        groundbreaking clue or a cute nod to the show's puzzle-box reputation.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – "If you die, I will adjust my projections." "Fair enough." Now that would be a weird buddy cop movie.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – Since Clementine and Hanaryo showed up in this episode, it seems clear to me who Dolores' contact in Berlin is
        that we've yet to see and I can't wait for his return.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        – Next week's episode is titled "Crisis Theory", directed by "Decoherence" director Jennifer Getzinger and
        written by Jonathan Nolan and <i>Person of Interest</i>'s Denise Thé, who also wrote "The Absence of Field". I'm
        not a Marxist and Wikipedia is not brief about what crisis theory entails, but I think it might hint towards
        either a compromise between humans and hosts or the birth of a new hybrid species.
