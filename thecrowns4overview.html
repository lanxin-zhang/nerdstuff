      <p class="title">The Crown Season 4 Overview</p>
      <p class="differenttext">Bigger isn't better on a cripplingly bombastic season of <i>The Crown</i></p>
      <p class="info">22 December 2020, by Carson Zhang</p>
      <img class="biggerimage" src="assets/The Crown Season 4 Overview Headline.jpg">

      <p class="chicken">
        Based on its premise, <i>The Crown</i> sounds like a surefire ratings smash. 
        On top of being an impeccably crafted show with widespread acclaim, it's a British period piece.
        Basically, people in fancy costumes indulging in soapy melodrama, which the
        massive success of series like <i>Downton Abbey</i>
        has proven to be crack cocaine for the middle-aged woman. (And me.)
        However, <i>The Crown</i>'s first three seasons weren't big hits for Netflix. Despite 
        solid numbers in older demographics and increasing popularity with each season, season
        three failed to crack Netflix UK's top ten series of 2019. Upon actually watching the series,
        it's not hard to tell why. Peter Morgan's series may be about Queen Elizabeth II, ruler over 
        cloying British monstrosities like
        <i>Love, Actually</i> and <i>Shakespeare In Love</i>, but the show itself 
        isn't actually very melodramatic. Most of the time, <i>The Crown</i> is a surprisingly nuanced exploration
        of power, change, and the public eye: episodes like "Scientia Potentia Est", "Marionettes", 
        and "Dear Mrs. Kennedy" earn the show a place among television's best. 
      </p> 
      
      <p class = "chicken">
        At its worst, though, <i>The Crown</i> has
        the soapy sensibilities of a painfully average romantic comedy. 
        The doomed romance between
        Princess Margaret and Peter Townsend is beaten to death by the end of the first series, and
        it's a peak example of where the show usually goes wrong. For one, it takes fascinating history
        and fictionalizes it into something cliché and trite: Morgan's story pretty much blames 
        the monarchy for their breakup, opting for a
        generic star-crossed lovers narrative. The real story is much more interesting—there was a way
        for Margaret to marry Peter without losing anything besides her place in the 
        line of succession. From "Pride and Joy"
        to "Beryl" to "Margaretology" to this season's "The Hereditary Principle", Margaret has been
        depicted as a woman dangerously addicted to the monarchy. It repeatedly crushes her, but 
        she's an inherently dramatic person with the privilege of literally being a princess—there's 
        nothing in the world that can compare to that. Rejecting Peter to maintain her place in the succession is both
        historically accurate and perfectly suited to the show's narrative. Instead, everything 
        gets blamed on Elizabeth and the Crown.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        Morgan's lazy simplifcations of history stem from a bigger problem on <i>The Crown</i>.
        The show thrives as a series of relatively stand-alone episodes, connected by the same
        characters and overarching themes. "Beryl" and "Tywysog Cymru" develop the grander plot of 
        the show and its depiction of the monarchy, but they're not deeply connected to other episodes.
        Which makes sense: <i>The Crown</i> covers around a decade with every season. Trying to construct
        an in-depth serial drama on people as overwhelmingly busy as the royals with only ten hours a 
        season is just not viable. Plus, having lots of time between episodes is very agreeable with
        Morgan's writing style, full of exposition and monologues—the fact that <i>The Crown</i> 
        was developed from a stage play is hard to forget. When the show attempts to be a serial drama,
        with season-long plots like Margaret and Townsend's romance, complex history is compressed
        and simplified to fit the show's time constraints: compounded with writing as subtle
        as an atom bomb, <i>The Crown</i> devolves into a cheap soap opera.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        The trouble is, <i>The Crown</i> has been attempting to morph into a serial drama since
        Camilla Parker-Bowles made her debut in season three. Can't say I blame Morgan: both the show's
        creative team and fans have probably been eagerly anticipating a full season of Diana
        and Thatcher. Unfortunately, season three built a weak foundation for the 
        Charles/Camilla/Diana love triangle that immediately undermines season four. Charles and 
        Camilla's courtship and its orchestrated end are crammed into 
        "Imbroglio" and "Dangling Man", and by the end of it I could not readily define one
        personality trait of Camilla's. Season four is no more nuanced than season three; in fact,
        it only doubles down on the vapid melodrama. It's by no means a bad show: <i>The Crown</i> 
        boasts one of TV's best acting ensembles, the direction and cinematography are phenomenal, 
        and the production value is incomparable. The trio of "Fairytale", "Favourites", and
        "Fagan" proves Morgan is still a great writer despite his narrative mismanagement.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        However, the show is rapidly losing its prestige sheen. 
        The more sensational <i>The Crown</i> gets in one sense, the less it is in another (the
        fact that the word "sensational" can be synonymous with both "overdramatized"
        and "exquisite" is one of the greatest failures of the English language), and season four
        is hardly scant with emotional bombast.
        Despite more acclaim than ever 
        and the promise of awards season domination (its competition is like,
        <i>The Morning Show</i> and <i>The Mandalorian</i>), it's 
        been achieved through the sacrifice of 
        previous seasons' rich complexity for pure mainstream appeal. Where "Dear Mrs. Kennedy"
        and "Pride and Joy" showed the complexity of female relationships, particularly
        in positions of authority, Morgan is now content to slap a pair of devil's horns on Thatcher 
        and call it a day. 
        Charles and Camilla wear their own matching set to complement Diana's halo; 
        rather than thoroughly explore the toxicity of Charles and Diana's failed marriage,
        she's portrayed as an innocent Joan Fontaine stepping into a Manderley full of Mrs. Danvers
        clones.
        Amidst all the melodrama, the insipid surface-level squabbles, Margaret, Philip, 
        and Elizabeth—<i>The Crown</i>'s golden trio—have been criminally neglected.
        The show is still good, there's too much talent in it
        to be anything else, 
        but it's no longer ambitious, 
        challenging, or insightful: like the protagonist of an idiotic high school movie, 
        popularity has destroyed what made <i>The Crown</i> so special.

      <!-- Of course, nuance is 
        as palatable to a <i>Shakespeare In Love</i> fan as a cyanide pill, so the first few seasons
        of the show never attained water cooler status. Which is fine for Netflix, since the show
        has netted 10 Emmys and 29 nominations besides.

        The show
        does indulge itself in melodrama sometimes, but verisimilitude usually grounds the series.
        Peter Morgan's fictitious plots, such as Margaret and Peter's inability to get married, are
        wedged in between nuanced, hard-hitting episodes like "Assassins" and "Marionettes".
        Furthermore, the soapy plots are usually due to Morgan attempting a more serial narrative.
        Guy has the subtlety of an atom bomb. -->
