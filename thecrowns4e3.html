        [Spoilers for <i>The Crown</i> season four episode three, "Fairytale"]
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        After a 
        couple of middling episodes, "Fairytale" is a refreshing reminder of what <i>The Crown</i>
        can be at its very best. Its a densely-detailed episode where Charles and Diana cross the perilous point of no return, but its polished focus on specific characters and themes is
        much more suitable to Morgan's writing style than the plot-heavy "Gold Stick" and
        "The Balmoral Test". Even though the episode covers a lot of narrative ground, it works much better because
        it's primarily a character study: the spotlight on Diana simultaneously allows Emma Corrin to deliver an incredible performance
        and develop <i>The Crown</i>'s biggest ideas with nuance, rather than the explicit inculcation Morgan
        sometimes gets caught up in. Without sacrificing characters' consistency, centering the episode around the new Princess of Wales
        allows for a much sharper indictment of the royal family than "The Balmoral Test" managed, and
        its acute pathos makes the sacrifices of royal life hit much harder than they did in "Gold Stick".
        Rather than making up for the show's writing, the direction and technical aspects of the show
        transform a fantastic story into the season's strongest episode: the Crown is hurtling towards catastrophe, but the show itself 
        has made an exceptional return to form.
      </p>  

      <p class="chicken">
        While Diana's arc throughout the episode (and the season) is quite similar to Philip's for the first two seasons, both
        learning to adjust to life on the outskirts of the family, "Fairytale" quickly derails to a much darker path.
        Philip often chafed under the rules, but he was always resilient and persistent; contrarily, Diana is 
        a shy and amenable girl who's completely out of her depth. The first two seasons focused a great deal on
        the family learning to bend to the Crown. By season three, Philip and Elizabeth are well-suited to their roles,
        and even Margaret seems to have found stability without Tony. Season four, on the other hand,
        seeks to show what happens when someone can't bend to the rules. Margaret puts it quite succinctly: they break.
        
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        The fragility of Corrin's Diana makes her suffering doubly tragic: where Philip was outwardly grating in his
        struggles with the monarchy, she retreats inwards and hurts no one but herself. Her complete breakdown as she,
        a girl who just turned twenty, 
        prepares to marry a grown man and become the future Queen of Britain shows the deep institutional flaws of the monarchy.
        While the family is always so keen on factoring out emotion in their choices, 
        Diana being a perfect bride on paper, it seems that emotion is the only thing
        that really makes a choice work. Elizabeth chose Philip
        despite general disapproval, Margaret became miserable after losing Peter, and even though the
        royals are not meant to divorce, Margaret (and Anne and Charles eventually) are much happier after
        they leave their spouses. It's what makes Margaret such a perfect voice of reason in the episode;
        as a woman who experienced what happens when the monarchy makes a choice about marriage, both
        firsthand with Peter and secondhand with the abdication, she knows more than even her mother about
        how toxic and self-destructive the rules can be.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        Unfortunately, no one warns Diana herself about what she's getting into when she accepts Charles' proposal.
        Speaking of which, his proposal is an absolute catastrophe: not only does he refuse to get on one knee (it's apparently 
        beneath him), but he just pops the question to her in the middle of a nursery. That's a historical
        detour that works very well: although he did get on one knee in real life, <i>The Crown</i> strips
        the affair of any romance—"It's done. I did it." is what he says to Elizabeth to break the news
        of his engagement. Of course, Diana is absolutely delighted by it all nevertheless; season four
        eventually gets out of hand depicting Diana as a completely innocent victim, but in this episode
        it's heartbreaking. In the afterglow of engagement, she parties with her friends and picks out a ring,
        only for Charles to rain on her parade with his "whatever 'in love' means" comment. (He said that in
        real life, and it was equally confusing.) 
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        That's when the torrent really comes in, washing away her happily ever after: Margaret unleashes her 
        icy ire on Diana in front of the whole royal family, Charles takes off immediately and suggests she
        hang out with his ex Camilla, and she struggles with isolation, rigorous dance lessons, and her grandmother's
        cruel training. It's a relentless barrage, which comes to an explosive head when Diana and Camilla hit
        the town together. Caron's tight frames, the anxious sound and picture editing, and Corrin's increasing
        panic lead Diana to her darkest moment, retching her meals into toilet. (Note: I guess the first time
        makes sense, but the shots of Diana vomiting are unnecessarily graphic. The sound of the tap running
        is much more chilling than the explicit act, and less triggering.) Her transformation from Disney princess into a pampered prisoner
        is horrifying; not only does she buckle under the weight of the crown, the family does nothing to help her.
        Though they do have their reservations, Elizabeth and Margaret especially, they idly watch as her life unravels
        with nothing to offer but a couple of sympathetic sentiments behind her back. Unlike the rest of them, Diana
        needs attention and help, but it's not something the monarchy is designed to offer. It's the most damning
        depiction of the Crown's process yet: one either bends or breaks,
        and Diana shatters to pieces.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        At the same time, the press falls in love with her, and the letters she receives help her get through
        her time alone in the palace. It's a great setup to her love affair with the press, something that becomes
        catastrophically weaponized against the royals when the public learns of the cracks in Charles and Diana's
        marriage. The way she steps up for public life shows surprising grit; Diana is hopelessly unsuited to 
        life in the royal family, but she can't be blamed for not trying. Her dancing improves, she wins over
        the public, and becomes the picture-perfect image of a princess. However, her commitment to making 
        her marriage works only makes it more tragic. As enchanting as she in her wedding dress, there's nothing
        but dread in her steps towards the aisle; the fairytale is shedding its skin, twisting into a nightmare, 
        but Diana refuses to keep dreaming.

        Miscellaneous details:
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — This episode was directed by Benjamin Caron and written by Peter Morgan.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — Early Emmy prediction: this episode is the show's writing and directing Emmy submission, and at the very least Caron wins.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — There is a mouse that runs across the palace in a scene with the Queen Mother, and
        serves no purpose in the scene. It looks like an accident to me, but the mouse is gigantic
        and the only moving thing in the shot; how could anyone miss that?
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — I think Elizabeth's secretary Martin Charteris should have been dismissed by now, but
        I don't really mind. Am kind of hoping they keep him in the next two seasons, played by
        yet another one of Lady Edith's suitors from <i>Downton Abbey</i>.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — “Prostitutes and Australians. Isn’t that who lives in Earl’s Court?” If you're gonna have
        such little Princess Margaret, might as well make the best of it.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — Roller blading in a palace looks so fun.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — I'm pleased that they showed the wedding rehearsal instead of the wedding: the wedding broadcasted a 
        fairytale, while the rehearsal revealed the ugly truth.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — I like the focus on Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, Anne, and Margaret when Charles calls to announce
        his proposal, and during the wedding rehearsal. It's familiar territory for all of them, and each of their
        reactions are priceless.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — Camilla gets a little more "blegh" than "eh" in this episode: the combo of the restaurant
        name (Ménage à Trois) and her "I'm all for sharing" comment is not a great look. Still
        eager to see <i>Promising Young Woman</i>, though.
