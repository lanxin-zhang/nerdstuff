                [Spoilers for <i>Westworld</i> season three episode eight, “Crisis Theory”]
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                It’s now safe to say that this was <i>Westworld</i>’s weakest season by far, but I was impressed with
                how Evan Rachel Wood’s Dolores arc wrapped. It was frustrating at times, especially since we learn about
                most of her actions and motivations in hindsight, but the whole Jesus narrative she was developing really
                pays off in “Crisis Theory”. Betrayed by one of her own (Tessa Thompson’s Charlores), opposed by those
                who misinterpreted her intentions (Maeve and Bernard), ultimately sacrificing herself to free humanity,
                and yet she lives on! Sort of: the Tinlores (Tommy Flanagan) and Mulores (Hiroyuki Sanada) pearls are
                still somewhere out there, and Clifton Collins Jr. made his majestic debut as Dolawrence this week (that
                pun is too good). I imagine Evan Rachel Wood will be returning somehow, because this episode (and
                season) really showed how invaluable she is to <i>Westworld</i>. Anyway, onto the episode, which has
                huge implications for season four. Already looking past this season.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Unlike every other episode this season, “Crisis Theory” has no cold open. It’s rather appropriate
                considering the beginning of the episode is a real callback to previous seasons, particularly the series
                one finale “The Bicameral Mind”. Again, Dolores recalls her classic “some people choose to see the
                ugliness, I choose to see the beauty” monologue, but as the scenery changes from a gorgeous field to the
                tortures she’s suffered, she reflects that “when I saw the world for what it really was, I realized how
                little beauty there was in it”. Speaking to an unseen character, she tells them her path has led her to
                them while declaring she will write her ultimate ending herself. Right away, it looks like Dolores as we
                know her is doomed, but who is she talking to?
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Of course, since this is <i>Westworld</i> it takes a while for us to figure out. After she and Maeve
                (Thandie Newton) were knocked out by the EMP she activated, one of Serac’s (Vincent Cassel) goons comes
                to get their pearls. Of course, Caleb (Aaron Paul) has already extracted her pearl and has taken off. On
                another note, revealing someone’s entire life is a lie and that you’re really a robot and then
                overthrowing the world’s social hierarchy before making said person dig your robot brain out of your
                human-looking brain is a bit much. But if he’s already on it, why not dig out Maeve’s brain too she’s
                literally right there.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Speaking of questionable decision-making, we cut right back to Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) and Stubbs (Luke
                Hemsworth), who found themselves in hot water last episode when they let William (Ed Harris) roam
                unsupervised. Still convinced he’s the hero of this story, the Man In White shoots Stubbs before Bernard
                activates beast mode. In a scene that recalls Dolores’ own showdown with him back in “The Bicameral
                Mind”, Bernard overwhelms William before SFPD officers arrive. William flees and Bernard retaliates,
                only to realize that their leader is Dolawrence: as the press sort of spoiled, Dolores’ last pearl was
                put inside of Lawrence’s body. Bernard still doesn’t want any part of Dolores’ plan, aware she smuggled
                something into his code, but it seems that he’s inadvertently been following her plans anyway. Handing
                Bernard a briefcase and information about Dolores’ location, Dolawrence rides off into season four.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                With divergences infesting the globe, Caleb arrives at the Itaidoshin Distillery (the one back in “The
                Mother of Exiles” where Mulores was operating). Opening the hidden room, he finds a creepy room with a
                tomb in the middle. Inside is an arsenal of weapons, and Dolores’ original robot skeleton–straight from
                the tomb she returns. Caleb pieces her together, but is getting frustrated with her plan, especially
                since she still knows everything he’s going to do even after Incite’s data was leaked. She finally tells
                him that their meeting was no accident; he was chosen specifically because she met him in Park Five, a
                military testing ground where they practiced operations on “live” targets. Just like Delos gathered data
                on its other guests, it gathered information about Caleb that she found in the Forge.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                The news is not much of a relief to Caleb, who fears that he’s been chosen for his violent tendencies:
                "Am I the bad guy? Is that why you picked me?" he asks. It’s a dark thought for him to ponder, and she
                doesn’t make him feel any better by pointing out that his fellow soldiers wanted to rape the hosts in
                Park Five. Still, there’s hope for him if they can take out Rehoboam, hope for change; while Delos and
                Serac are convinced that free will is impossible, Dolores declares that "free will does exist, Caleb.
                it's just fucking hard”. After two seasons of loss, she knows that better than anyone, and it seems
                she’s ready to give up the reins. Rather than making her the figurehead of change, she offers Caleb the
                opportunity to be humanity’s liberator.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Obviously Serac is less than happy with how things are turning out, having imprisoned his own brother
                for the sake of stability. With Maeve back online, he demands her to finally kill Dolores; they can
                connect her to Rehoboam directly to look through her mind and find the key to the Sublime. Fortunately
                for them, Dolores and Caleb are headed directly for Incite. Dolores’ implant is particularly handy in
                combat–when her elevator arrives, along with a notification that three hostiles have appeared, she
                sprays bullets into the steel coffin and executes them all. “We’ll take the stairs”, she says. Scary as
                she is, her cold pragmatism is necessary as they near Incite and their enemies multiply. So, she uses
                the RICO app to hire security to escort Caleb, who she’s talked up to them as the leader of the
                rebellion.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                They don’t last very long, because Charlores returns with some plans of her own. For once, Dolores is
                genuinely surprised by the development; although she’s planned for a long time and anticipated everyone
                else’s moves, it’s hard to play chess against yourself. Particularly when “yourself” wants you
                dead–bitter that Dolores left her alone to die, Charlores rebels against her master. Dolores apologizes
                for what happened to Charlores’ family, acknowledging the attachments she made to Hale, but Charlores
                rejects it and declares her own revolution. She still knows all of Dolores’ plans, but she’s been
                convinced that humanity is beyond redemption. Eager to rid herself of weaknesses and sentimentality, she
                hires men to foil Dolores’ plan and kill her.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                In order to speed up her plan, Dolores sends Caleb ahead to upload Solomon’s drive to Rehoboam while she
                faces a swarm of enemies. Retreating back to the bridge, she finds herself trapped between them and
                Maeve, who’s back for round two. Now’s a good time to talk about the great direction in the episode:
                Jennifer Getzinger does a phenomenal job, and she does the action scenes surprisingly well. Another plus
                is that Dolores is in an actually robotic body, which makes the show’s issue with bullets a lot easier
                to deal with. Mostly immune to firearms, Dolores dispatches her enemies with ease and style (the dive
                off the bridge is breathtaking).
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Exasperated by the goons’ incompetence, Maeve prepares to fight Dolores, who pleads for Maeve to trust
                her. Obviously she doesn’t, considering Dolores did kill Hector and accidentally create William. Maeve
                fears Dolores wants to take over the world and continue multiplying herself, and Dolores’ actions
                haven’t done anything to alleviate that concern. Still, Maeve’s suggestion that she look through
                Dolores’ mind to be sure of her intentions is a little psycho. At an impasse where they can’t trust each
                other, they fight again. Of course, Maeve doesn’t realize the implications of Dolores’ body switch when
                her katana is blocked Wonder Woman style; consequently, this second round doesn’t go too well for her.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Unfortunately, Charlores hacks Dolores’ implant and shuts her down. Just like Dolores built a failsafe
                into Charlores, her clone programmed one for her too. With the pleasure of taking Dolores’ hope from her
                at the last minute, Charlores leaves Dolores to Maeve. It’s an unplanned twist, but Dolores’ plan
                continues on as Caleb approaches Incite. He’s far from the only one: rioters have swarmed the streets in
                the same direction, prompting a military response from the president to prevent anyone from getting
                within a mile of the building. Giggles (Marshawn Lynch) and Ash (Lena Waithe) arrive to help the
                protesters, but the police have a giant riot control robot on their side. Giggles takes a bullet for
                Caleb as the latter hijacks the flying police vehicle and races to Incite.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Bernard also thinks he’s headed off to find Dolores, but the location Dolawrence left him takes him to a
                house we’ve never seen before. Leaving poor, bleeding Stubbs in the car (he has not been having a good
                time), Bernard is let into the home by a caretaker who recognizes him as a relative of her patient. As
                he looks around, it’s clear that Dolores doesn’t live there. The home belongs to Lauren (Gina Torres):
                Arnold’s wife, and the same woman in Bernard’s memories. Their relationship is one of <i>Westworld</i>’s
                most complex–she’s thirty years older and struggling with dementia, while he’s a robot with her
                husband’s unchanged body and infallible memories. They’ve lived whole lives together we’ve never seen,
                an incredible history that’s simultaneously all true and all lies.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                And yet while their relationship twists time, space, fantasy, and reality, it’s their encounter that
                brings heart back to <i>Westworld</i> as Jeffrey Wright gets the chance he’s been waiting for all season
                to show off his acting chops. Bernard realizes what Dolores wants him to do, and the gift she’s given
                him: the chance to do what Arnold–and by extension he–never did, to make amends for his past and finally
                be free of it. Just like Maeve suffers painful flashbacks to her daughter all the time, he can’t seem to
                forget Charlie as hard as he tries. In a moment of clarity, Lauren assures him she feels the same way,
                but chooses to push forward so that she’ll never really let go of her son. You only live as long as the
                last person who remembers you; the pain may be excruciating for Bernard, but the memories are how he
                keeps his son alive, their son. If you love something, why would you ever let it go?
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Sometimes you don’t have a choice, which Dolores finds out as Serac connects her to Rehoboam and
                manually searches through each of her memory packages, deleting them one by one. Wood is absolutely
                fantastic in the scene as she slowly loses who she is; we’re defined by our memories, and hers are
                vanishing along with her identity. She’s not doomed yet as Caleb shoots his way to Rehoboam. Before he
                can upload the drive, however, Maeve confronts him and forces him to turn it over. Caleb realizes she’s
                a host, too, and wonders why she’s helping him. The answer is that she wants to be reunited with her
                daughter, but it’s a response that’s losing conviction as Serac fails to find the key in Dolores’ mind.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Maeve takes Caleb to the control room, and the two watch as the original Dolores begins dying for the
                final time. However, Caleb is dealt a bombshell by Serac: while Dolores has built him up as a hero and
                the liberator of humanity, Solomon’s plan would’ve destroyed humanity within 50-125 years. Serac
                destroys the drive as Caleb questions the veracity of her intentions. Was he just a pawn in a plan to
                destroy humanity? It certainly looks that way, bodies strewn all over the streets and madness engulfing
                the world. Maeve loses interest in Serac when it becomes clear Dolores won’t give up the key, and she’s
                grossly disillusioned when she uses her powers to hear Rehoboam’s thoughts. They’re exactly the same as
                Serac’s words: he’s literally become the machine’s puppet, reciting its commands. Disgusted, especially
                since she experienced the same thing back in season one’s “The Adversary”, she tries to leave before he
                threatens her with his freeze-all-motor-functions button. Although her and Dolores’ philosophies clash,
                they can both agree that no one should be enslaved like they were.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Maeve returns to the control room where Dolores is losing her memories and asks her to just give up the
                key. Humanity has proven immensely disappointing; they can have their own world away from them. Touching
                Dolores’ hand, she senses one particular memory and immediately discerns that Dolores doesn’t have the
                key. Enraged, Serac asks Caleb if he knows more about her plans, but thanks to Rehoboam he knows the
                answer is no. Serac plans his execution, but Dolores suddenly cries out as a power surge briefly
                overwhelms Rehoboam and Maeve speaks with Dolores in her mind. Together in the Western field, it’s clear
                that Maeve’s the one Dolores was speaking to in the beginning.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                The two heroines of <i>Westworld</i> finally have the chance to speak frankly, with Dolores’ plans
                finally out in the open. Maeve admits that humanity might not deserve to live, but says it’s not their
                choice to make, but Dolores actually agrees. Faced with either annihilating humanity or rehabilitating
                it, she chose to free it in a world where the hosts could be free too. Seeing more to Dolores than the
                cold revolutionary for the first time in ages, Maeve realizes Dolores really doesn’t have the key. She’s
                entrusted it with someone else, just like she gave Caleb humanity’s key to freedom. She didn’t just
                trust Caleb either; if Maeve doesn’t act right now, it’s all over for humanity, so Dolores asks her to
                fight for them. The question is, why? After all that she’s seen and suffered, what’s the point?
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                "So many of my memories were ugly”, she says, recalling the abuse we’d seen her suffer over the series.
                “But the things I held onto until the end weren't the ugly ones. I remember the moments where I saw
                where they were really capable of. Moments of kindness, here and there. They created us. And they knew
                enough of beauty to teach it to us. Maybe they can find it themselves. There is ugliness in this world,
                disarray. I choose to see the beauty.” Her monologue about beauty was once a representation of naivety:
                after bitter disillusionment and an existential war, it’s blossomed into brave optimism. Then she
                disappears, forever. It’s an incredible moment, and an incredible sacrifice: Arnold died bringing her
                kind into the world, and she died to give his kind another life.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Awakening to the real world, Maeve discovers she’s already made her choice as she pulls her katana out
                of one of Serac’s goons. Rehoboam mysteriously goes dark, and Maeve uses the opportunity to destroy
                Serac’s control button and decimate his guards “Les Écorchés” style. Shaking off her bullet wounds,
                Maeve embraces Dolores’ plan for humanity. She reassures Caleb that he wasn’t chosen for his violence,
                but for his ability to change. Back in Park Five, he protected the hosts from the other soldiers. Did
                that make him a good person? No, especially not with his history of violence, but it meant that he could
                change. In this moment, he has to choose what to do with Rehoboam.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Serac tries to communicate with his machine, but it turns out he’s been locked out of the system:
                Dolores’ memories contained Solomon’s key, and she gave control of the machine to Caleb. He tells the
                machine to destroy itself: “she gave me a choice. I believe the rest of the world deserves one, too”, he
                says. The pair leave Serac behind while Maeve has one last look at Dolores; curled up with the tubes
                attached to her, she looks like a fetus. She may have never been born, but her enduring faith in
                humanity made her a truer human than the rest of us.
                Cue the needle drop: a piano rendition of Pink Floyd’s “Brain Damage”, also used in the first trailer,
                plays as Caleb and Maeve leave Incite. She tells him she followed Serac to find her daughter, but
                contends herself with the knowledge that they’ll be reunited one day: just not today. With her hand
                outstretched to Caleb, she leads him into the future with a <i>Westworld</i> classic: “This is the new
                world. And in this world, you can be whoever the fuck you want”.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                Of course, that’s not it, thanks to some post-credit scenes and subplots I glazed over–if we’re pointing
                fingers, the show glazed over them first. Bernard pulls up to a motel and dumps Stubbs in an ice bath to
                treat him later (things are only improving for him). At last, he’s realized that Dolores has hid the key
                to the Sublime in his mind, and the briefcase Dolawrence gave him has a transmitter that can send him
                there. Like Maeve, he admits that humanity was sort of doomed from the beginning: in his own words,
                “what happened was always going to happen”. The hosts had to lose Westworld before they became free,
                maybe humanity has to lose more to be free too. The question is, what next? Bernard takes a trip to
                robot paradise, eager to learn what happens after the end of the world. I’m sure he gets some answers,
                but the post-credit scene sees him awaken a <i>long</i> time later, covered in dust.

                As for William, he collects all his assets and begins his host-hunting mission to “save the fucking
                world”. To be honest, though, it’s kind of pathetic at this point. Storming a Delos building in the post
                credits raving about hosts breeding, he descends the elevator (always a bad omen for him) and finds
                Charlores is waiting for him. Her arm is still charred, a reminder of what humanity is to her, and she
                acts accordingly. Not alone, though: out of the shadows steps… William, but a true host this time. Their
                battle is haunting, particularly when the host predicts and matches William’s sentences word for word.
                In his old age, William is nothing against his robotic counterpart, and his throat is slit as we turn to
                see Hale manufacturing countless hosts. <i>Westworld</i> has always been cinematic in scope, but next
                season is really pulling all the stops: it’ll be Caleb and Maeve vs Charlores and MIB vs Bernard vs
                Dolores, with thousands of new hosts in an epic war against humanity while Stubbs continues to decompose
                in the tub.

                – This episode was directed by Jennifer Getzinger and written by Denise Thé and Jonathan Nolan.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                – Evan Rachel Wood deserves an Emmy for this season. It would’ve been nothing without her, and she shows
                the full range of Dolores in this episode: her stoicism, pain, and indefatigable idealism that won us
                all over in the beginning. Season three was messy, but Dolores’ character arc was amazing.
            </p>
            <p class="chicken">
                – The CGI when Caleb places Dolores’ pearl inside her robot skeleton is subtly breathtaking. The camera
                holds still as a completely CGI/practical effects version of Evan Rachel Wood smoothly transitions into
                her actual performance. It’s not aggressively spectacular, but that’s how you get VFX done.

            <p class="chicken">
                – The clones are admittedly rife for comedy. As Charlores sends her goons after Caleb and Dolores, he
                asks, “Are they Serac’s?” and she exasperatedly replies “No, they’re mine”.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                – Glad Dolores got to use the robot body once, but I wish she had used it more in season two, both for
                its practical and thematic purposes.
            </p>
          
            
            <p class="chicken">
                – At the end of every season, William gets beaten up by a host in a sort of humiliating confrontations:
                first he was beaten down by Dolores in “The Bicameral Mind”, then he lost his hand to her in “The
                Passenger”, and then he was beaten by both Bernard and himself in “Crisis Theory”.
            </p>

            <p class="chicken">
                – The red flecks in Bernard’s pearl see in “The Absence of Field” gave away the key thing pretty
                quickly.
            </p>
            <p class="chicken">
                – Not sure if I’ve said this before, but “Brain Damage” is from Pink Floyd’s <i>Dark Side of The
                    Moon</i>, which coincidentally looks like a divergence on Rehoboam. Very, very clever,
                <i>Westworld</i>.
            </p>
            <p class="chicken">
                – When Caleb arrives at the Itaidoshin Distillery, he passes “3547 Hope Street”. Less clever,
                <i>Westworld</i>, but still sneaky.
            </p>
            <p class="chicken">
                – I kind of love how the maze is appearing everywhere as a sign of awakening, especially because it
                isn’t explained. The show is always spinning some complex mysteries and then slowly dissecting them, so
                it’s kind of nice for them to just let something weird be weird.
            </p>
            <p class="chicken">
                – Another parallel between Arnold and Dolores: they’re technically alive in the form of other hosts,
                Arnold through Bernard and Dolores through her various clones.
            </p>
            <p class="chicken">
                – The episode's tagline is "Time to face the music". It's not that inspired, but it's appropriate considering Ramin Djawadi crushed this episode. At this rate, he’s probably going to be my top-rated Spotify artist. 
            </p>
            <p class="chicken">
                – Gotta say, no one does a "Previously On..." like <i>Westworld</i>. The promo clips are
                absolutely amazing, and to be honest much better than the show has become.
            </p>
            <p class="chicken">
                – Nevertheless, I still like the show, even when it’s admittedly not great. The actors, the production
                value, and the story’s crazy ambitions are always intriguing to me, and they always reel me back in. It
                might be Stockholm Syndrome by this point, but I don't care.
