      <p class="title">My Dream 2020 Emmy Ballot</p>
      <p class="differenttext">Because of those acting noms for <i>The Morning Show</i></p>
      <p class="info">16 December 2020, By Carson Zhang</p>
      <img class="biggerimage" src="assets/2020 Emmy Ballot Headline.jpg">
      <p class="chicken">
        I like the Emmys a little more than the Oscars, I think because there's a chance that they can redeem themselves.
        After an excessive sweep by <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, Claire Foy and Thandie Newton bagged the drama actress awards while
        <i>The Americans</i> was finally honored with wins for Matthew Rhys and writing duo Joel Fields and Joe Weisberg. Of course,
        that very same year <i>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i> swept for a decent first season over <i>Barry</i> and <i>Atlanta</i>.
        Much like the Oscars, the Emmys make the same dumb decisions every single year, but every once in a while they make an inspired choice 
        (examples from this year include Jeremy Strong, Uzo Aduba, and the <i>What We Do In The Shadows</i> breakthrough) that restores an infinitesimal 
        amount of faith in the industry for me. I'm shallow so it's enough for me, but not enough for me to
        stop making stupid lists about what I would pick instead. Especially because of <i>The Morning Show</i>. It's gonna sweep 
        next year, just because that would piss me off. Also because there's no competition because of COVID-19, yay. Oh yeah: this
        blog was dead because I was lazy but since I'm working on <i>The Crown</i> later I figured I'd put some old stuff I'd written
        down somewhere. Anyways: if I was an Academy voter and not just an idiot addicted to television, these are the television shows from summer 2019-spring 2020 that I would nominate, ranked preferentially in 
        descending order. Get ready to skim a lot.

          <span id="dots1"></span><span id="more1">To be honest, this category and pretty much every other comedy field is kind of bad. Outside <i>What We Do In The Shadows</i>
          and frontrunner <i>Schitt's Creek</i> (who literally won everything in this field), everything was kind of eh. I loved
          the second season of <i>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i>, but this season was uneven and jumbled outside a few highlights. 
          It was still better than <i>The Good Place</i>, a consistently decent comedy, and <i>The Kominsky Method</i>, which just
          isn't good. To feed my deranged neuroses, perennial nominee <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> and perennial snub
          <i>It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia</i> have secured spots on this list. They both didn't have their best seasons in a while,
          but they're still keeping things freshly horrific after over a decade each. <i>Sunny</i>, although frequently fluctuating, continued to be 
          an ambitious and relentlessly innovative series. It doesn't always land, but its peak moments (which have yet to begin) are maniacally incomparable. <i>Dead To Me</i> and 
          <i>Insecure</i> (whose Molly vs. Issa drama also enraptured President Trump, apparently) were much more polished this year,
          with the writers' season-long plots bringing needed acuity to frequently brilliant shows too often muddled by indulgent meandering.
          <i>Schitt's Creek</i> was a solid winner in this category for a heartwarming send-off, but surprise nominee 
          <i>What We Do In The Shadows</i> is just so much better. I didn't think it was gonna win, its nominations were more than
          enough, but come on; its combination of witticisms, farce, and pure lunacy turned the dumbest TV show premise (until <i>Barry</i>)
          into an excellent comedy that's far surpassed its source material. 
          However, <i>GLOW</i> was operating on a whole other level this season. Maybe it's because they've realized that the season two snubs
          (despite critical acclaim) meant that they were getting cancelled soon, but season three went crazy by restructuring the show as a series of 
          vignettes. After a season of superb serial comedy and drama, season three's scope drastically widens. The broader perspective
          only brings us closer to our beloved crew of misfits, whose deeper individual stories produce better performances (particularly
          from Alison Brie) and allow the show to be more delightfully ambitious than ever. Just like the in-universe show's cancellation
          inadvertently fuelled its innovation, <i>GLOW</i> is owning its tragic cancellation with hardhitting drama and absurd hilarity.
          It's one of the best comedies on TV, but the crown belongs to another overlooked series: Pamela Adlon's <i>Better Things</i>. 
          Honestly, this season was just devastating for me: it was like <i>Lady Bird</i> on repeat. Helming every episode with her
          loving eye, Adlon elevates the mundane into blissful divinity. I've detested how later seasons of comedies often get desperately 
          sensational (digression: ironically, <i>Curb</i> and <i>It's Always Sunny</i>, two of TV's most maniacal series since day one,
          have gotten tamer), but <i>Better Things</i> defies tradition by zooming in on the little details of life to produce 
          big laughs and hearty sobs. Also, 
          I have tried Sam Fox's chili and it is damn good. Five star stuff, just like the show.</span>

        <p class ="chicken">
          <span id="dots2"></span><span id="more2">I haven't seen <i>Ramy</i>, which I should really get on but awards season and actual school are beating me to death.
          I have seen <i>The Kominsky Method</i>, and Douglas is not remarkable. Neither are Anderson or Cheadle, who are just fine as usual. 
          In their place should've been the male leads of <i>What We Do In The Shadows</i>, whose antics would bring a lot of levity
          to a category that isn't very good. Novak always kills me with his deliveries, but the stupid Bloody Mary crisis in
          "The Curse" definitely takes the cake. However, his costar Matt Berry gets the better material when Laszlo takes off to become
          Jackie Daytona, bartender and champion of girls' volleyball. It's as deliciously stupid as usual, but there's a weirdly
          heartwarming element to the episode brought by Berry that really cements the episode as a <i>Shadows</i> highlight.
          Between them is Gleeson, because he was pretty good even though his show wasn't. Also, because this category is weak.
          "Jump" is the darkest episode of <i>Run</i>, and it gives him the chance to deliver a haunted, broken performance.
          Not really comedic, but that ain't my fault. Blame the submission process. His chemistry with Wever is fantastic throughout
          the series, and the horrifying twist in "Jump" produces some <i>Ex Machina</i> level work from him. Then there's just a 
          fun group of old comedy legends who are as good as ever. Larry David a petty curmudgeon, Danson a cheery demon, and Levy
          the straight man to the deranged Rose coven, they're a great bunch. Although I'm not sure why Levy won: he was good,
          but the role wasn't exactly giving him groundbreaking material. Between him and Danson, though, as the only ones I would've
          picked on an actual ballot, I don't really care.</span>

        <p class = "chicken">
          <span id="dots3"></span><span id="more3">Okay, now this one is pretty fun. Applegate, Brosnahan, Cardellini, and Ross are all really good, to be honest. Great category,
          but unlike the other comedy categories this one is actually stacked. O'Hara won at the actual ceremony, and she 
          absolutely deserved it. The weird accent, the ridiculous flourishes, and the crow-like screaming, she's as good as it
          gets in a comedy actor field post-Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Following her is Brie, because I love an episode where an 
          actor plays a character who is acting. Her performance-in-a-performance is great, but its only the cherry on top in an 
          episode that resolves Ruth's romantic tension with Sam before blowing the whole thing wide open. It's a huge twist for Ruth,
          and it only works because of Brie's thoroughly compelling performance. Less intense but beautifully nuanced is Adlon, whose
          Sam Fox is as funny and whacko as ever. "DNA" sees her chase down her mom and force her to spit like, a cup full of saliva into a vial,
          and then lob sexist slurs back and forth with her eldest daughter in a rage-fueled scene which dissolves into amusement and 
          tenderness. It's no wonder Adlon showed it at TCA: it's a testament to her acting that such a difficult scene elegantly winds
          down to meet her directorial vision, even while it seems like she's not really doing anything. <i>Run</i> doesn't quite juggle
          comedy and drama as effectively, but Wever certainly can in "Jump". After a couple of fantastic comedic deliveries 
          (the absolute glee in her eyes as she proclaims: "she's an idiot!" would make a top-notch meme), she and Gleeson flex their
          dramatic chops as things get twisted. She may be lower on this list than Gleeson is on his, but she's better; especially in
          "Jump", she carries the show's shifting tones where the writing and directing can't. Rae deserves recognition as per usual, 
          especially for the rosy "Lowkey Happy", and for the biggest and best season of <i>Insecure</i> yet. The beef between Issa
          and Molly is definitely relatable for most people, but its hard to visualize the way that a close friendship can subtly
          dissolve into apathy. The performances of Rae and Orji are subtle, but they excellently navigate the micro and macro conflicts
          that can rot two peas in a pod. I deliberated a lot on the last spot, which I wanted for Brosnahan to be honest, but she faltered
          in a weaker season of <i>Maisel</i> while Fanning triumphed as the one highlight of the generally mediocre <i>The Great</i>.
          She does a full Sansa Stark in <i>A Game of Thrones</i> during "The Great", withering from a bright and hopeful
          Cinderella into a despairing, hateful captive. Her range over the course of the pilot is tremendous, and even though the 
          show is kind of a disaster, her transformation from Sansa Stark to Alayne Stone does live up to the show's title.

          <span id="dots4"></span><span id="more4">This one is pretty bad. For starters, though, it's not really my fault. Still haven't seen <i>Ramy</i>, 
          <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> is not good and its performances are consistently average, I never loved Levy's acting, 
          and Thompson is one of the weaker members of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> who's been nominated for an Emmy. And like, barely any people nominated
          for SNL deserve it. Arkin and <i>The Kominsky Method</i> are beyond dead to me, while Brown had a single impressive moment 
          in a largely forgettable role. I've held onto Harper for <i>The Good Place</i>, because he gets a pretty great episode to show off
          the highlights of what he's been doing for four years and finally complete Chidi's evolution. Shalhoub usually deserves to win,
          but this year his plots were pretty irritating in spite of his solid work. Without good material, Maron passed him with
          "Hollywood Homecoming". Maron has always been surprisingly good on <i>GLOW</i>, and he gets to be the hilarious asshole 
          he always is in "Homecoming" while sharing plenty of tender moments with his daughter. Plus, his reaction to a potential death
          sentence and spontaneous cover-up for his daughter's sake are absolutely heartbreaking. And then... a lot of <i>Sunny</i>. Howerton is my favorite
          actor on the show, and "The Janitor Always Mops Twice" is the cherry on top (haha) of a season full of twisted
          moments for Dennis. Howerton impressively commits to the episode's style without losing any of his comedic edge; the same is 
          true of Day, who leads the episode with a performance that's both deeply immersive and cacophonously hilarious.
          Frank stole Dee's thunder in "Dee Day" when DeVito put his own legendary spin on Martina Martinez, even funnier than before with a side of 
          clam sickness to boot. It's an episode of excellent comedic deliveries (blaming the valet's absence on a car crash before said crash happens is magnificent)
          and the repulsive physical comedy DeVito has proven so good at, vomiting clams all over his fake breasts.
          Hayes is still killing it on <i>Will and Grace</i>, and with
          better writing he might have topped this list with his frantic deliveries and bombastic physicality. Burrell might have too
          for a better season of <i>Modern Family</i>, but he's easily still the best actor on the show. Plus, I love a good <i>Psycho</i>
          homage. Except for that weird Gus Van Sant remake, that was the definition of a waste of time. </span>

        <p class ="chicken">
          <span id="dots5"></span><span id="more5">Marin Hinkle was a solid nominee last year, but without much to do this season I don't really see why she deserved
          a nomination when Lynch finally started earning her awards. Then there's the SNL ladies, who are probably the best
          of the pack, but that show has been aging like that box of cookies in my brother's drawer for three years. Which is a 
          fair simile, because SNL really is stale at this point and honestly should be considered in a different category anyway.
          <i>Sunny</i> 's fourth season is a little short on dazzlingly disgusting Dee moments, but her misguided attempts to defend "A Woman's Right To Chop"
          make for a pleasantly grotesque showcase that lets Olson unleash her unique brand of flailing lunacy.
          Mullally and Carden are just as good as ever, neither of them getting incredible material but still
          delivering consistently great performances. Orji, on the other hand, is particularly good in a season where
          Molly sort of becomes the villain while still remaining sympathetic (contrary to the beliefs of Twitter) and kind of a 
          mess. Borstein didn't have an amazing season on <i>Maisel</i>, but Susie ripping into Sophie Lennon was pretty great.
          Annie Murphy is probably the first of these nominees to be consistently great while still getting equally great material.
          She's as funny as ever in <i>Schitt's Creek</i>'s final season, but "The Presidential Suite" lets Alexis have a sweet 
          moment with Ted where they make the mature (gasp!) decision to split up to let him pursue his dream. Alexis ends the season
          without much fanfare, but this scene was what the obnoxious Kardashian-esque icon of <i>Schitt's Creek</i> deserved for her
          send-off. Equally mischievous but much more subtle is Imrie as Phil, whose
          delightful little showcase in "Carbonara" that reminds us just how good she is when she comes into focus. Casually trying to
          run cons and telling people her daughter is Cate Blanchett (the setup is flawless: Phil tells a guy her daughter is famous,
          there's a brief moment where it looks like she'll say some nice things about her actress daughter Sam, but of course
          she goes with Blanchett instead), Phil's antics mask the unsettling threat of dementia that the occasional cracks Imrie allows
          in Phil's tenacity mark as inevitable. Without that much material though, it's hard to opt for her over Gilpin, who
          is sort of a lead but has been cheating the system for years in this category. Don't really care though, go her. 
          Gilpin selected "A Very GLOW Christmas" as her submission, which is fair, but I feel like "Desert Pollen" was her most 
          moving work this season. Debbie's slow progression into bulimia is subtle, but Gilpin quietly races towards it
          in every little scene with frustrated agony. Her scenes with Ruth are a great contrast to last season's shouting match, and it allows
          Gilpin to portray the complexities of her insecurities: she knows that Ruth is right, she knows she's being crazy, 
          and yet she only allows herself contentment after emptying their late-night snack into the toilet. It's brutal and tragic,
          and Gilpin lets it unravel across her face in all its ugliness with raw vulnerability.</span>

        <p class = "chicken">
          <span id="dots6"></span><span id="more6">There are a lot of differences between me and the Emmys here, so I'll just run through 
            them quickly: haven't seen <i>Ramy</i>, 
          <i>Will and Grace</i> and <i>Modern Family</i> aren't good anymore and were only nominated because they were finales, 
          <i>The Great</i> is an exceptionally weaker version of Yorgos Lanthimos' <i>The Favourite</i>, and <i>Maisel</i> and <i>Schitt's Creek</i>
          were both good but neither was particular inspired. Cullens and O'Malley, on the other hand, rely entirely on inspiration: 
          <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> is eligible for a writing nomination for the first time this year,
          while <i>It's Always Sunny</i> isn't submitted at all. Although each is written to some extent, a lot of each show revolves around
          improvisation, hence the director's importance to each show. Of course, I'm more particular towards <i>It's Always Sunny</i>'s 
          black-and-white noir, shot through with the sinister red of... cherries. Weaving between the moody atmosphere and the series'
          moronic bickering, "Janitor" is a riotously funny artistic triumph. I feel like "On The Run" would probably be a more logical choice for <i>What We Do In The 
          Shadows</i>, but I was crying to death for pretty much all of "Colin's Promotion" so I ran with that one instead,
          especially because it wasn't submitted for writing. Then we have <i>Dickinson</i>, which I think is sort of good and sort of horrible
          but is inspired in the craziest way. The writing is often inconsistent, but the gorgeously melodramatic goth visuals, combined with
          the edginess of Billie Eilish's music and an acting role for Wiz Khalifa, reflect pretty well on Norris' ability
          to express his very specific vein of bat-shit insanity. <i>GLOW</i>, on the other hand, is able to match its visualize
          audacity with an equally impressive story. "Outward Bound" is the show's most daring episode, and perhaps its best;
          it relies heavily on dialogue, but the character interactions are informed by the camera across the empty plains.
          In a sort of <i>Better Call Saul</i> "Bagman" way (getting to that one later), it transforms a well-written episode 
          into a whole cinematic experience. 
          <i>Maisel </i> is one of the best directed shows on TV,
          and "It's Comedy or Cabbage" was one of season three's occasional bouts of greatness. Palladino frames
          Midge and Lenny's will-they-won't-they with the lovely indulgences of a classic fairytale, but underscores it with
          a subtle warning Carol makes to Midge; the love story wilts even as it blooms, and before long the rosy tint of romance
          is replaced by the ugly mess of Lenny's room.
          And of course, Adlon is number one for <i>Better Things</i>, because it's the best of this bunch by far. As expressed
          in tangents above, she expresses so much passion and affection in the most simple things. While most shows
          scramble to get bigger and better every week, Adlon finds perfection in humility. <i>Better Things</i> doesn't 
          aspire to anything more than an honest portrayal of life, and yet it's more affecting than any of its sensational peers.

        <p class = "chicken">
          <span id="dots7"></span><span id="more7">Quickly again: <i>What We Do In The Shadows</i> is great and the nominations were fantastic, but for real it really
          didn't warrant that many writing noms. McNamara's work on <i>The Great</i>, again, is nowhere near <i>The Favourite</i>.
          <i>Schitt's Creek</i> isn't amazing enough to warrant two nominations, and the finale is obviously much better. 
          <i>The Good Place</i> ended pretty well, but to be honest it didn't feel that moving to me in spite of all the drama.
          Probably because I never really liked most of the characters, anyway, oops. Anyway, <i>GLOW</i> submitted
          both the crazy remix episode "Freaky Tuesday" and season highlight "Outward Bound", which should both be in.
          Crazy remix episode because it was a great crazy remix episode, and "Outward Bound" was the series' best use of its
          character ensemble yet. <i>Dead To Me</i> belongs in here for its bleakly hilarious ending, which manages to ingeniously
          resolve all the show's plots peacefully before throwing the same wrench into Judy and Jen's lives in the most twistedly 
          funny way. <i>Schitt's Creek</i> had a great ending, a touching resolution that also included some funny twists
          (Alexis' dress was questionable, while Moira's wig was literally divine), sending the Roses off into their corners of
          the world as much better people. I've already exalted Palladino's "It's Comedy or Cabbage", so I'll just say that 
          Lenny and Midge's whirlwind night of romance is top-notch rom-com material, but it's the sad ending, where the clock
          strikes midnight and the magic leaves, that makes the episode one of <i>Maisel</i>'s best. If it weren't for the pretty
          weak side plots, this would be win-worthy stuff. 
          At last we come to "On The Run", a 
          typically ridiculous episode of <i>Shadows</i> and an
          uncharacteristically moving one. Against all odds, Laszlo actually does a lot of good for the community, and his story
          unironically works as an entirely different show. Mark Hamill's appearance is hilariously dumb as ever, and his 
          disruptions (both literal and tonal) of the Daytona narrative are an implicit reminder that Laszlo can't escape his past. 
          It's actually kind of sad,
          which I didn't think the show could do. Anyways, <i>Better Things</i> is obviously on top, but not for Adlon. I guess she
          and FX chose not to submit her for consideration, which is actually pretty considerate seeing how most shows only submit
          episodes by the showrunners. “Batceñera” has so many satisfying payoffs; much like with Max's
          graduation, Frankie finally gives her mom her due. Even better, everyone else seems to as well: Duke, Rich, Jeff, and Tressa
          all go after Xander, who I almost felt bad for her until he forgot her daughter's age. Frankie is briefly likeable, Xander
          is universally despised, and the weird sexual tension between Jeff and Sam escalates: all in all, it's a great episode for <i>Better Things</i>.

        <p class="chicken">
          <span id="dots8"></span><span id="more8">Yes, this list is all HBO and Netflix, but that ain't my fault. HBO is the best network out there, and Netflix
          dumps out so much content that some is inevitably good.<i>Succession</i> swept the Globes, Critics’ Choice, WGA, 
          and PGA, and yet it still exceeded all expectations at the
          Emmys with an astonishing eighteen nominations, half of which were for acting (up from zero last year, for good
          measure). Awarded with series, writing, directing, and casting, plus an inspired win for lead actor Jeremy Strong, the
          show has pretty much cemented itself as HBO’s next Emmy magnet. It’s not shocking why: <i>Succession</i> has the
          water-cooler appeal of <i>Game of Thrones</i> and the scathing wit of <i>Veep</i>. It’s traumatically compelling like
          reality TV, but the writing’s polish gives a slick sheen to the tumultuously addictive soap. Still, this is hardly a
          competition in my mind: <i>Better Call Saul</i> is the best show on TV, and it just had its best season. It’s already
          been outpacing <i>Breaking Bad</i> for years, more nuanced and subtle than its predecessor. The collision of Jimmy's
          law practice and the cartel was everything I hoped for while Kim's dark turn was anything but; the bottom line is, whether <i>Better Call 
          Saul</i> is fulfilling long-awaited fan wishes or yanking the rug out from under us, it's the smartest and most nuanced
          drama on television. With a shot of adrenaline before the finish line, season five has cemented the show's reputation
          not only as one of the best show's right now, but of all time. 

          <i>My Brilliant Friend: The Story of A New Name</i> is even better than its predecessor, exploring one of the most 
          fascinatingly complicated relationships on TV. Lila and Elena's saga of jealousy, adoration, hatred, and love is steeped
          in the brutality of Naples, where Elena launches outwards and Lila spirals in circles. Similarly, <i>The Deuce</i> doesn't
          shy away from the sheer ugliness of life; even its weaker final season is an evocative plunge into America's darkness, 
          anchored by Maggie Gyllenhaal and Emily Meade. <i>The Crown</i> also faced a weaker third season, but its inability to find
          actual drama for Elizabeth while foolishly twisting the Charles-Camilla story into a melodramatic fairytale made for a much
          steeper decline from its stellar sophomore season. Still, stunning episodic highlights like <i>Tywysog Cymru</i>
          and the sublime production help the show maintain its status as one of TV's strongest dramas. I love the concept behind
          <i>Mindhunter</i>, but the generally weak characterization and interactions really hinder what could be a reallly great show.
          Still, David Fincher's series handles its complex narratives with a steady hand, while shows like <i>Ozark</i> and
          <i>Westworld</i> have absolutely no control over what's going on anymore. I don't think either season was really good 
          (outside the top three these are not peak content), but <i>Ozark</i> has at least become engaging while <i>Westworld</i> 
          spontaneously shows flickers of its old excellence in a scattered third season. Plus, even though the season was weak,
          the team behind the show is so good that it pretty much appears in every category below anyway.

        <p class = "chicken">
          <span id="dots9"></span><span id="more9">Jason Bateman and Steve Carell are excellent at playing themselves and just okay at everything else, so basically
          their performances are just okay and should not be anywhere near the nominations list. Brown and Porter are good,
          but they're behind mediocre shows; Brown's performance has lost some of its affects thanks to the show's
          Now this was a great choice by the Emmys. Jeremy Strong snagged a surprising TCA nom that slightly lifted my hopes
          for him at the Emmys, but I had sort of expected <i>Succession</i>'s massive nomination sweep to advantage Brian Cox instead.
          Logan Roy is boisterous, mercurial, and menacing, an absolutely torrential role that Cox revels in throughout
          the haunting <i>Lord of The Flies</i>-esque "Hunting". Basically, awards bait. In this season, Kendall basically 
          acts like a kicked puppy until "This Is Not For Tears". I believe that's the episode Strong submitted for the Emmys,
          which makes sense, but the way he's able to convey decades of trauma from a single look in "Return" is something else.
          You'd think it'd be hard to have much sympathy for a billionaire's asshole son, but the way he completely regresses
          into a little lost boy at his father's beck and call—the posture, the face, the voice—is just too depressing. 
          Behind the stars of <i>Succession</i> are Odenkirk and Menzies, who each had a notable spotlight episode that made up
          for their backseat roles. Odenkirk was fantastic, but Seehorn and Dalton were the real stars of the season; 
          nevertheless, "Bagman" gives him dehydration, the perpetual fear of death, and the looming presence of his dead brother
          as he realizes that allying with the cartel was probably a bad idea. Philip's struggles in "Moondust" are much more 
          internal, but the episode is equally concerned with the very core of its protagonist. Menzies is a perfect replacement for
          Smith's take on the prince; it's nice to see that Philip's pledge of devotion in "Mystery Man" actually had big narrative
          implications. While retaining the mischievous charm of previous seasons, Philip is much more mature—he even talks about his
          feelings! "Moondust" is the perfect illustration of his arc over the past three seasons, through the frustrations and 
          suppressed traumas towards self-enlightenment. Aaron Paul's equivalent episode, "Passed Pawn", doesn't hold up nearly as well,
          but it does finally give Paul something interesting to do. Like Newton, Wood, and Wright before him, he gets to conceptualize
          the superlative existential crisis as the ugly truth of Caleb's life is laid before him. It's sort of like his performance 
          as Jesse Pinkman on <i>Breaking Bad</i>, but I don't really care because it's still good. As for McCallany, I think he's a much
          better actor than Groff and this season really showed that. His character is gruff and headstrong, but he literally has to
          cope with his young child's culpability in murder. It's the most Fincher role in <i>Mindhunter</i>; like Freeman in <i>Seven</i>,
          he stares despair straight in the face. It's bleak as hell, but McCallany doesn't ever get hammy with it. Though his performance
          is deliberately restrained, you don't forget for a second that his son helped tie a dead child to a cross. (Jesus.)

        <button onclick="Emmy2020Ballot10()" id="button10" class = "readmore">Press to unleash the rant:</button>

        <p class = "chicken">
          <span id="dots10"></span><span id="more10">To be honest, Oh is no longer good on <i>Killing Eve</i>. It's not really her fault, but that character has pretty much
          entirely stopped being interesting and she has practically no compelling material to work with anymore. Zendaya and Aniston
          are good, but not great. They definitely won extra brownie points as industry darlings taking on very serious roles, 
          which they admittedly did well, but Aniston is too performative while <i>Euphoria</i>'s writing doesn't really fulfill
          Zendaya's surprising potential. (That <i>Euphoria</i> special though, now that's something.) 
          Comer is still great, especially with a submission like "Are You From Pinner?", but it's a crowded field and even Villanelle
          is getting exhausting on <i>Killing Eve</i>. Things are pretty tired on <i>Handmaid's</i> too, but Elisabeth Moss
          (admittedly a personal favorite since she played Peggy on <i>Mad Men</i>) is still giving one of the best performances on
          television. The show's writing is a flailing mess at this point, but Moss' work in "Liars" is the best example of how
          the show's actors are keeping the show afloat regardless. The scene in which June kills Winslow is a lazy contrivance by the writers,
          but the way that all of June's smug confidence goes away as her trauma resurfaces is haunting. Even though Winslow only dies for the 
          plot's sake, something a quick overview of the season's arc can confirm, in that moment Moss is so compelling that it feels organic.
          Colman isn't a great Elizabeth, to be honest; she's not playing the same character that Claire Foy was in almost any way.
          However, the performance she's giving is still great, if that makes sense: she's just not exactly playing Elizabeth anymore. 
          "Aberfan" shows how different she is—they literally gave Colman an earpiece connected to the shipping forecast to prevent her
          from emoting—but it also shows how interesting her own character is. That last shot of Colman, a single tear rolling down her face—that's 
          just perfect. On a terrible season of <i>Big Little Lies</i>, Kidman was still nomination-worthy in "I Want To Know", butting
          heads with Meryl Streep in an episode that was entirely carried by their performances. Also, she basically carried a generally
          awful season with the only semi-coherent narrative. <i>Ozark</i>'s "Fire Pink" was a better submission for Linney; although
          it's writing wasn't genius either, it let Linney and Pelphrey work their magic as they ran out of time. With Garner
          getting weaker material this season, Linney was the MVP of <i>Ozark</i>'s third season as Wendy went all in with the cartel. As 
          <i>The Deuce</i> wrapped its final season, Gyllenhaal's Eileen surprisingly got less screentime—not really sure why, considering
          literally everyone prefers her to James Franco's Vince. But anyways, Eileen's direction to her actors in "This Trust Thing", detailing
          an abortion her father forced her into, is pretty much all it takes to merit her place on this list. Of course, Evan Rachel Wood
          takes my #1 spot, however. Pretty much everyone on <i>Westworld</i> is masterful, but pretty much all of the good stuff goes to
          Dolores in season three and Wood crushes every bit of it. She's still a stoic badass, but in later episodes—particularly "Crisis Theory"—she
          reveals countless layers of emotion to Dolores. Combined with all the little technical details she puts into being a robot, it's
          a perfect role for an actor of her caliber.
          The technique is perfect, the emotion is heartbreaking; Wood
          literally does everything in her role as Dolores Abernathy, and there's nothing she isn't great at.

        <p class = "chicken">
          <span id="dots11"></span><span id="more11">The fact that Braun resorted to submitting "This Is Not For Tears" shows just how undeserving he was of a nomination.
          Cousin Greg is fun, but there is no way that performance warranted accolades over Banks, O'Connor, or Pelphrey. The same
          is still true of Culkin despite his superior work: this category is too stacked for coattail nominations. Frankly, both
          of them are better choices than Duplass for the morning show, who could have actually been replaced with a lego replica.
          I might have preferred it. Esposito is good as ever, but this was Dalton's season on <i>Better Call Saul</i>. As the charismatic,
          wily Lalo, Dalton was already a fan-favorite before his bone-chilling turn in "Bad Choice Road". The painfully tense scene
          between Jimmy, Kim and Lalo was hands down the best acted sequence this year. It's what gives him the edge over the ever-great
          Jonathan Banks, who had his slimmest season to date. As per usual he still delivered a great performance, deeply troubled by his
          actions at the end of "Winner", but I think that speech to Jimmy near the end of "Bagman" probably wins him my laurels.
          Mike is still the coolest and cleverest guy on <i>Better Call Saul</i>, and he brings his mojo back to deliver a kickass
          monologue to Jimmy that gives him a little hope and a crazy plan.
          Whitford was solid on <i>Handmaid's</i>, 
          but to be honest Wright's one scene of value in <i>Westworld</i> season three pretty much outshone the work of almost all
          the other nominees. Like Thompson and Wood in "The Absence of Field", he's able to realize a relationship outside human
          comprehension that's still emotionally devastating in the most human way. Crudup and Pelphrey stole their respective shows,
          but I'd give Crudup the edge; his performance as Cory is fascinating, but it feels very natural on a show with clunky writing.
          Pelphrey, on another show with clunky writing, can't always escape the melodrama of <i>Ozark</i>'s scripts. Nevertheless,
          he had a season full of great moments that culminated in his tragic turn in "Fire Pink". Macfadyen is the best of the 
          <i>Succession</i> supporting cast; Tom is a revolting clump of garbage, and yet it's hard not to feel bad for him with every
          wounded look Macfadyen delivers as Shiv tramples on her husband. Macfadyen's American accent, flamboyant deliveries, and 
          petulant tantrums simultaneously make Tom <i>Succession</i>'s most horrible and pathetic character, which is no easy feat.
          Like <i>Wright</i>, <i>Harris</i> had a little role in <i>Westworld</i> season three, but "Decoherence" is a worthwhile reminder
          that he's one of the great actors of our time. Cycling between several iterations of the Man In Black, Harris fires on all fronts
          while jumping through hoops to satisfy <i>Westworld</i>'s complex story. I'd be tempted to just say he's the best, but since
          he had such a minimal season I'd defer to Josh O'Connor, who completely blew me away as Prince Charles on <i>The Crown</i>. The role
          is honestly fantastic PR for the Prince of Wales, whose timidity and artistic curiosity are charmingly evoked by O'Connor
          in the season's highlight "Tywysog Cymru". It's a full coming-of-age story packed in an episode, and O'Connor brings all the emotions
          to save the muddled plotting of "Dangling Man" and "Imbroglio". Mark my words: he's going to be a huge star. (I said the 
          same of Vanessa Kirby and Florence Pugh, so I am always right.)

          <span id="dots12"></span><span id="more12">I love a good meme and I love Laura Dern more than cheesecake, but Renata was nothing more than diversionary comic relief
          in <i>Big Little Lies</i> season two. Shaw and Wiley got better material, but their shows haven't been good in a while
          and their performances aren't nearly enough to elevate the writing. Garner is still delightful on <i>Ozark</i>, but
          the writers barely gave her anything to do in season three. Frankly, McTeer was almost a better choice, but Garner's
          "ya fuckin' bitch wolf" was the tipping point for me. Thompson gave the best performance of her career in "The Absence of Field", 
          one of <i>Westworld</i>'s classic acting marathons: she nailed Wood's Dolores mannerisms, conveyed the birth of a robot, 
          and began blending her old performance into her Dolores performance with the typical robot glitches that <i>Westworld</i> loves.
          Newton had a weak season, but "The Winter Line" was solid enough for her to deserve a nomination. The episode features
          all the cunning, quips, and brilliance we've come to expect from Maeve, but also heartbreak and despair like we've never
          seen before. Also, that look on her face when Hector's pearl is crushed in "Decoherence" haunts my nightmares. Snook is great on
          <i>Succession</i>, but I'd posit that "Tern Haven" is a better submission than "The Summer Palace". While the latter is an excellent
          tightrope walk for Shiv, compelled to show her hand but fearful of a false promise, "Tern Haven" is a major turning point for her arc.
          Much like with "The Summer Palace", Shiv is as confident and brash as ever, but her cockiness is underscored by the simmering
          anxiety that her father won't hold up his end of their bargain. The disastrous dinner blowout is majestic, but it's perfectly set up
          by Snook's slow meltdown over the episode as her anxieties take over. After a season of relative irrelevance, Gugu Mbatha-Raw
          completely outacted everyone on <i>The Morning Show</i> in the gut-wrenching "Lonely At The Top". After delivering an engaging
          performance that keeps the retrospective episode entertaining, Mbatha-Raw's explosive moment is so undeniably magnetic that even
          <i>The Morning Show</i> can't help but be absolutely excellent. Streep's arrival to <i>Big Little Lies</i> was slightly disappointing,
          but little fault can be found in her incredible performance. It's strange, capricious, and cleverly vicious, an expectedly
          fantastic immersion into the world of <i>Big Little Lies</i> by one of our greats. Bonham Carter was just as great a replacement 
          for Kirby
          as Menzies was for Smith; she retains Margaret's hedonistic delights while beginning to feel the consequences of her escapist
          lifestyle overwhelm her. Plus, her technique is simply perfect; the voice, the posture, all the way
          down to the way she holds her cigarettes
          (I suppose we have Bonham Carter's psychic to thank for that), Carter is impeccable. However, this category was a lock for Seehorn
          ever since 
          <i>Better Call Saul</i> aired "Wexler v Goodman". She's always been criminally underlooked for the show, but her performance
          as Kim finally lost it with Jimmy was simply undeniable. Not really because she was denied again, but it was so good. 
          <i>Saul</i> approached the end of her story by hurtling curveballs at us, 
          and Seehorn delivered each with astonishing credulity: twists like offering to marry Jimmy and sabotaging Howard seem almost
          too insane, but Seehorn makes good on the writers' confidence with every single one. Even while she continues to play the straight man
          to Jimmy's antics, the Yoko to his John, she's subtly been revealing darker layers to Kim for seasons that she begins to let loose
          in "Wexer v Goodman". Quietly, Kim Wexler and Rhea Seehorn have become the best part of a show populated by <i>Breaking Bad</i> 
          favorites.</span>

          <span id="dots13"></span><span id="more13">To be honest, most of the nominated submissions were pretty good: it's just a really competitive field.
          Second nominations for <i>The Crown</i> and <i>Ozark</i> are easier to drop because they're much weaker than their companion
          submissions. <i>Succession</i>'s "Hunting" won the Emmy, which is not a bad choice at all, but to be honest I prefer
          Mark Mylod's collaborations with the writing team. The surrealism of "Hunting" doesn't always work, but Mylod's established
          style produces season highlights "Tern Haven" and "This Is Not For Tears". He knows exactly how to work with a large ensemble,
          carefully choreographing every scene to capitalize on the show's rapid dialogue. Bateman is a much better director than
          actor at this point, and he does a great job with "Fish In A Barrel": the camera creeps around the edges of the action,
          lurking like a malicious predator, setting the tone for the show's particular brand of stylish horror. <i>Sopranos</i>
          veteran Sakharov does better work on <i>Ozark</i> with "Fire Pink", however, drawing out great work from Pelphrey and Linney
          while escalating the tension of their doomed escape plan. Through all of <i>Ozark</i>, it's the only time where I've felt utterly
          enthralled by the material. Hall has been doing great work on <i>The Deuce</i> for a while, and his work on the sparkling rot
          of "The Camera Loves You" is the classic mesh of pageantry and revulsion that the show has come to excel at. Like all David Simon
          projects, <i>The Deuce</i> is obsessed with establishing an evocative environment, and Hall beautifully launches us into a 
          final hours of HBO's diamond in the rough. On another criminally neglected HBO show, Costanzo's <i>My Brilliant 
          Friend</i> thrives for another season under his supervision. It's as poetic and bestial as ever, and his ability to translate
          a deeply complex novel's narrative onto the screen cannot be understated. <i>Westworld</i>'s premiere was primarily driven
          by Nolan's direction, and its not hard to see why he chose to helm the premiere. With "Parce Domine", Nolan brings <i>Westworld</i>
          back to its roots in the best ways while dipping the epic West into the modern world's deep sense of melancholy. Whether it's
          the surprisingly great action scenes—led by an equally cool and scary Evan Rachel Wood—or Caleb's hopeless lack of direction, 
          "Parce Domine" shows just how great <i>Westworld</i> can be when its visionary creators take the reins. A better season of
          <i>Westworld</i> might deserve a win, but Gilligan taking on <i>Saul</i>'s sweeping desert epic "Bagman" begs to differ.
          The action is shot with adrenaline, and the standalone isolation episode recalls <i>Breaking Bad</i>'s phenomenal
          "4 Days Out". It's a major turning point for the show, and Gilligan makes the most of the episode with stunning shots that
          flex the visual beauty he mastered on <i>Breaking Bad</i>. Unexpectedly, Caron wound up being my favorite this year with
          "Aberfan". While the episode isn't as good as "Tywysog Cymru", Caron—responsible for remarkable episodes like "Scientia 
          Potentia Est", "Assassins" and "Beryl"—does the heavy lifting with his brilliant direction. His knowledge of the camera
          is clear the staging of every scene; he knows how to zero in on key ideas with intimate closeups, but he also knows how
          devastating a detached shot from a distance can be. Since <i>The Crown</i> has already aired its fourth season by the time
          this is done, I'd also point out that he's the best director of season four too: "Fairytale" is barreling towards the Emmy.

        <p class = "chicken">
          <span id="dots14"></span><span id="more14">Two things: first of all, <i>Ozark</i> should not be anywhere near a writing nomination. It's a fine show, great
          in terms of acting and directing, but that writing is really just not it. Second of all, yes it's kind of weird
          that <i>Better Call Saul</i> has all the top slots but honestly it might as well sweep the list. Instead I just took
          the last three episodes, which only get better and better. Gordon Smith, <i>Saul</i>'s ace in the hole, 
          delivers an incredible episode with a devilishly clever arc for Jimmy. "Bagman" also sees Seehorn and Dalton square up
          as Kim begins working with the cartel, which inadvertently saves Jimmy during the agonizing ending of
          "Bad Choice Road". Then the whole Lalo situation boils over in catastrophic fashion in "Something Unforgivable",
          while Kim's full endgame arc is chillingly realized as <i>Saul</i> plunges into the abyss. Every episode seems
          perfect, and yet they miraculously improve in succession. Speaking of which (haha!), <i>Succession</i>> might have 
          topped Smith's "Bagman" if they submitted Will Tracy's "Tern Haven". Much like Morgan and <i>The Crown</i>
          , who never submit a co-written
          episode to a detrimental point ("Tywysog Cymru" > "Aberfan"), they went with Armstrong's solo episode instead.
          "This Is Not For Tears" is admittedly amazing, full of all the great character interactions that made "Tern Haven"
          work, it lacks all the <i>Gosford Park</i> stuff that made <i>Succession</i>'s sojourn into Shogun World (
          because "Akane No Mai" is also an S2E5 I'm so clever) the series' best episode. It's still pretty far ahead of the rest
          besides the superb <i>My Brilliant Friend</i>, which did pick the wrong episode (I'd have gone for "Ghosts") but still
          brings some huge twists to Lila and Elena's ever-changing dynamic. Here's hoping Nino accidentally falls off a bridge.
          Anyways, "Aberfan" isn't the best written episode of <i>The Crown</i>'s third season, but it does tap into the
          difficulties of Elizabeth's practiced stoicism for the first time. It's a fascinating look into the monarch, but it would
          definitely deserve more acclaim if Colman didn't always look like she was about to burst into tears. Last and sort of least,
          <i>Mindhunter</i> had a stronger second season with sharp focus and intricate plotting. It struggles to make its characters
          as interesting as its subject matter, but its exploration of serial killers is peak Fincher stuff. Like the twisted love child
          of <i>Gone Girl</i> and <i>Seven</i>, it's a piercing look into the debauched mess that is the human mind.

        <p class="chicken">
          <span id="dots15"></span><span id="more15">Okay, <i>Little Fires Everywhere</i> just isn't it. Washington and Witherspoon are good, but the show is decent
          at best. <i>Unbelievable</i> and <i>Unorthodox</i> are pretty great, but each suffers from unevenness and narrative
          bloating, issues <i>Mrs. America</i> dodges through its almost-anthological exploration of the 1970s feminist movement.
          With phenomenal work from Byrne, Martindale, Ullman, Paulson, Aduba, Banks, Slattery, and Blanchett, the show is an
          acting masterclass with some knockout spotlight episodes to boot. <i>Normal People</i> deservedly took the world by
          storm with a coming-of-age story which, against all odds, actually felt like a real coming-of-age story! With 
          the marvelous Abrahamson behind the camera and the remarkable duo of Edgar-Jones and Mescal, <i>Normal People</i>
          elevated a political soap into a touching tale of two weathered lovers bound by fate. In that sense it's similar to
          Alex Garland's <i>Devs</i>, but that premise is as far as their similaries go. Garland's maniacal Frankenstein project
          is both flat-out horrible and breathtakingly genius in so many ways, but with the way it ends I can't see any way
          that it doesn't end up high on this list. It's an eerie, intelligent, and surprisingly heartwarming tale with
          such outstanding production design that I literally replicated it on Minecraft. <i>Watchmen</i> managed its audacity
          much better than <i>Devs</i>, spinning Alan Moore's classic graphic novel into a startlingly relevant story of
          America's traumatic roots. It's an outlandish romance epic, it's a brutal censure of nostalgia, it's a scathing
          attack on America's past, it's Jeremy Irons farting,
          it's literally everything ever wrapped into the origin story of the goddess Regina King. Against all odds, though,
          <i>The Plot Against America</i> stole the top spot for me. I typically hate aggressively political stories, especially
          revisionist ones like <i>The Plot Against America</i>, but the Levin family's mounting terrors as political tensions
          rise all around them felt frighteningly relevant. No matter what side of the aisle you're on, Bess' anxiety as 
          lines are drawn across America are a common feeling for most today, and the nightmarish "Part 6" is one of the greatest
          TV episodes in history. Kazan gives a career-best performance alongside a fantastic ensemble, and directors Minkie Spiro
          and Thomas Schlamme colorfully realize David Simon and Ed Burns' vision of a darkly divided America in a little Jewish 
          neighborhood.</span>

          Okay, Jackman was pretty good and honestly nomination worthy, but Pope was just fine on a show that was just flat-out

          as political forces on <i>The Plot Against America</i> polarize out of
          control. Crowe gets credit for being great in a transformative role on <i>The Loudest Voice</i>, and had the writing
          been much better he'd be a threat for a win. As it stands, he's the dazzling highlight of an irritably uninspired show.
          Irons really begins killing it near the end of <i>Watchmen</i>, delivering some surprisingly vulnerable moments with
          Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and some acidic banter with Jean Smart's Laurie. I really love their brief interactions, because
          both actors effortlessly convey the characters' decades of history in a handful of unrelated sentences. Still, the overall
          lack of meatiness turns his role as Ozymandias to dust before Ruffalo's dual performances in <i>I Know This Much Is True</i>.
          I mean, he plays twins well—he was destined for that Emmy since he got casted. As delightful as it was to see Mescal get
          nominated, I think it would've been much better for him to upset for the win. He's basically the Josh O'Connor of this category,
          a skyrocketing star carrying <i>Normal People</i> with the eloquent ease of a seasoned veteran. The scene where Connell
          goes to therapy proves exactly how worthy he is: he's simultaneously breaking down and actively trying to restrain his tears,
          and he walks that delicate line so smoothly that an earnest depiction of depression hits much harder than any
          tear-jerking melodrama.</span>

          Spencer is a solid actress, but much like Washington she's attached to a sunken ship that does absolutely nothing
          to capitalize on her talent. Haas and Dever's shows are much better, and mine much better work out of their 
          breakout stars; they're both heartbreaking in tremendously challenging roles, one as a Hasidic Jew on the run
          and the other a victim of sexual assault. <i>Unbelievable</i> and <i>Unorthodox</i> tackle other topics outside
          Dever and Haas, but they're never better than when they put their two extraordinary leads in the limelight. 
          King is fantastic as ever—TV collaborations with Lindelof clearly agreeing with her—and <i>Watchmen</i> gives her
          the craziest arc imaginable to handle. Between the anxiety-inducing "This Extraordinary Being" and the whimsically
          romantic "A God Walks Into Abar", plus unforgettable line deliveries ("Hey baby, we're in fucking trouble" and
          "Get the fuck up off the pool" are immediate classics), she's simply incredible. However, <i>Watchmen</i> is less
          actor-centric than <i>Mrs. America</i>, which heavily depends on Blanchett and her costars to tell its story.
          Blanchett is transformative to a tee, but her take on Schlafly isn't purely villainous—with unexpected nuance, 
          Blanchett and <i>Mrs. America</i> avoid overly vilifying Schlafly with an enchanting performance so full of conviction
          and calculating ambition that it's hard not to find her impressive (detestable as she may be). I expected this category
          to just be a big toss-up between Blanchett and King, but then <i>The Plot Against America</i>'s "Part 6" came around
          and Kazan left me awestruck. Bess doesn't witness most of the atrocities in the episode, 
          but the cheery facade she papers over her utter terror
          to calm down Seldon is the earth-shattering moment of the episde. Outside all the action with no one on the other 
          end of the line, Kazan's solo performance steals an episode featuring anti-Semitic riots and the assassination of
          the president.</span>

          Okay, I know that it would've looked bad if <i>Watchmen</i>—which tackles America's history with anti-black racism—wound
          up only nominating Nelson in this category, but <i>come on</i>. Abdul-Mateen II and Gossett Jr.
          gave solid performances that lacked any range, while
          Adepo was admittedly great (another <i>Leftovers</i> alumnus killing it on another Lindelof project) but lacked sufficient
          material to warrant a nomination. Not only was Nelson consistently delivering the best male performance on <i>Watchmen</i>, but
          his depiction of unspeakable trauma in "Little Fear of Lightning" recalls some of <i>The Leftovers</i>' finest hours, which
          is probably the best commendation I can give anyone. At least nominate him, for Christ's sake. Anyway, I think Burgess
          is a fine actor but I just can't but despise the character Titus—the combination of flamboyant bombast and <i>Kimmy Schmidt</i>'s
          abusive obsession with cringe humor is too much for me. Parsons was the obvious choice from <i>Hollywood</i>, but I found
          him generally one-note and uninteresting, while McDermott salvaged frequent periods of inanity with a spirited performance
          that made Murphy's deranged fanfiction series occasionally enjoyable. He's the only one I wouldn't sacrifice in a fire.
          Slattery didn't get enough credit for playing second fiddle on <i>Mrs. America</i>; Fred is a fascinating figure whose
          struggles with emasculation—very Matt Smith in <i>The Crown</i>'s first season—add layers to the effortless charisma
          Slattery showed on <i>Mad Men</i>. Boyle and Turturro are both excellent on <i>The Plot Against America</i>, but the edge
          definitely goes to Torturro for the restless anxiety that overtakes Bengelsdorf as his plans start to fall apart. In "Part 6",
          his performance warns of the impending chaos as his sleazy self-assurance forcefully crumbles into helpless despair. <i>El Camino</i>
          was a passable <i>Breaking Bad</i> spinoff, but Plemons shockingly stole the movie as the terrifyingly hilarious Todd.
          Plemons demonstrated his excellence with eccentric characters on <i>Fargo</i>, and the man-child psychopath takes Ed
          Blumquist to a whole new level of insanity. Todd is the equivalent of an assault rifle-armed toddler, which is absolutely
          horrific but also darkly hilarious.</span>

          This category was extremely stacked, mostly because of <i>Mrs. America</i>, hence the Collette and Ullman bumps.
          I had no qualms with ditching Taylor; she's good, but <i>Hollywood</i> did nothing for her. I waver back and forth
          on the acting in <i>Devs</i>, but the only constant in my mind is that Pill is extraordinary. She's a piercing menace, 
          a Mrs. Danvers-type tertiary character stripped of all morality. Even so, she does get one great emotional burst as
          she sends Forest into the Deus machine. Still, <i>Devs</i> is hardly an actor's vehicle while <i>Mrs. America</i>
          and <i>Watchmen</i> each spared whole episodes for individual actors to shine. Byrne is an excellent Steinem and
          Martindale is as reliably extraordinary as ever, but Aduba outclassed both as Chisholm in the crushing "Shirley".
          <i>Mrs. America</i> doesn't hesitate to censure the flaws of the activists it admires, and Aduba's gut-wrenching
          performance shows how utterly neglected the black community was in the feminist movement. She's an inspiring beacon
          of passionate rebellion, but it's in the quiet moments of depleting hope that Aduba gives her best work in a
          personal-best performance. Only she was on a level with Smart's exuberant role in "She Was Killed By Space Junk".
          Faced with conceptualizing the fate of one of comics' most iconic heroes, Lindelof brings out the big guns with
          Smart's dynamic take on Laurie. Over the course of <i>Watchmen</i>'s first truly great episode, Smart dazzles as 
          a smooth-talking
          badass bearing countless lives' worth of cynicism. The criminal absence of her character in later episodes really
          robs her thundering debut of its due, but that last little spat with Irons' Ozymandias does ease the blow. Chau,
          who frankly deserved much better considering just how good she as Lady Trieu, takes center-stage in <i>Watchmen</i>'s
          final hours and immediately makes it clear how undervalued she was. <i>Watchmen</i>> pushes boundaries at every turn,
          owing a great deal to its actors to pull off a cacophonously winding plot, and none are more challenging than Trieu's
          megalomaniac attempt at apotheosis in "See How They Fly". Chau is magnificently maniacal to the end, making her brief
          tenure on the show an immediately classic turn.</span>

          Shelton, no. Green is a fair choice, but I'd bump him to make room for Garland's <i>Devs</i>. You can say what you
          want about the show's polarizing writing and acting, but the directing is some of Garland's best work. Beyond the
          distortion of identity in <i>Ex Machina</i> and reality in <i>Annihilation</i>, Garland takes his ambitions to 
          even higher heights with the spectacularly insane <i>Devs</i>. It seeks to explore nothing less than the fundamental
          dissection of the human race and the creation of worlds; powered by Garland's almost Icarian ambition, the sole strength of
          <i>Devs</i>' direction results in
          a defining piece of television for the ages. As a key part of the creative process that defined <i>Watchmen</i>, Kassell's contribution
          to the show can't be understated. Building on her brilliant foundation with some bold
          artistic choices, Williams helmed the series-best episode "This Extraordinary Being". It's what lifts the show's vision beyond
          Schrader's direction of <i>Unorthodox</i>, a show that thrives on powerful visual storytelling and a keen eye for 
          performances. Abrahamson applies the intimate sensibilities of <i>Room</i> to <i>Normal People</i>, elevating the show's
          initially weaker writing with a mesmerizing, immersive atmosphere. Like Caron on <i>The Crown</i>, he is acutely aware of
          his camera's intimacy, knowing when to let his captivating actors lead a scene and when to rely on a scene's setting to evoke
          powerful imagery. As <i>The Plot Against America</i> finally reaches its boiling point, Schlamme holds nothing back in the
          harrowing nightmare of "Part 6". It's a full-hour of crippling tension and sinking dread, punctuated only by horrific brutality
          and sheer terror. Even with all its other achievements aside, Bess' phone call to Seldon makes this episode win-worthy.

          It was mostly just a question of whether to hold onto <i>Unorthodox</i> or <i>Normal People</i>, two shows whose
          directing far surpasses their uneven writing. However, <i>Unorthodox</i> is disadvantaged by being wholly written by
          one person; <i>Normal People</i>, on the other hand, had the privilege of submitting one particularly great episode.
          "Episode 3" has a lot of plot developments, and they all land hard: Connell standing up to Rachel, 
          Marianne turning her back on the whole
          school, Lorraine laying into her son, and Connell's shattering moment of vulnerability on a lonely street. The team
          of Unbelievable earned their nomination with a powerful exploration of trauma, and just exactly how a rape charge
          can tear the victim apart. <i>Unbelievable</i> subsequently struggles to maintain momentum, but its premiere's pitch-black 
          reflection of America's justice system is nothing short of phenomenal. "Shirley", the highlight of <i>Mrs. America</i>, 
          turns the show's scathing lens to the mirror as it reflects on the feminist movement's very own imperfections. It's an 
          intelligent, uncharacteristically astute criticism of the political left that resoundingly echoes today. Furthermore,
          it gives the trailblazing Chisholm her due alongside icons like Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan, a place
          she's deserved for decades. <i>The Plot Against America</i>'s "Part 2" is much weaker than "Part 6", but it's 
          a great illustration of the looming storm clouds threatening the Levin family. "This Extraordinary Being" manages
          to radically redesign iconic <i>Watchmen</i> characters in a way that honors the source material while connecting the 
          Hooded Justice's past to the Tulsa massacre ingrained into Lindelof's take on the series. It's a daring remix that 
          pays off in spades, plunging Angela into a mind-bending exploration of America's dark history and launching
          <i>Watchmen</i> towards its final confrontation. Like all of the show's best twists, the Hooded Justice arc deftly 
          intertwines itself with existing lore to expand the <i>Watchmen</i> universe in a way that simultaneously enriches
          the source material and reflects the centuries-long struggle against racism that defines this new chapter of the story.
