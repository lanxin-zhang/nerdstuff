        [Spoilers for Westworld’s season three premiere, “Parce Domine”]
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        After nearly two years, Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan’s sci-fi series Westworld has finally returned for season three. Stylistically, it’s becoming a whole different series. The warm hues of the West and the cold hues of the Mesa have been replaced by stark whites, blacks, reds and blues. There’s stunning skylines, transforming dresses, and self-driving motorcycles. Spiritually, however, it’s the same show. Shot in Singapore, 2058 is breathtakingly gorgeous, but as Aaron Paul’s Caleb reminds us, a coat of paint can’t cover the rot of a dying world. Algorithmic determinism has its foot on humanity’s neck, forcing people to conform or be confined to the outer edges of sanity. Humans are indistinguishable from the hosts, slaves to technology whose days endlessly loop. While we’re a long way from Kansas and Westworld itself is nowhere in sight, it’s clear that the show’s third season still takes place within a theme park in the wild west.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        We begin the season with Evan Rachel Wood’s Dolores, now a guest in the real world, getting some resources and a little bit of revenge against one of her past tormentors: Gerald, played by Thomas Kretschmann. As a robot herself, the digital security that protects his home is easily disabled by her. Her condemnation of humanity’s reliance on technology is glaringly relevant — while machines operate nearly every aspect of people’s routines in Los Angeles 2058, their grip around us is swiftly tightening already. Technology tells us how to get places, where we should eat, when to wake up; compounded with data mining from companies like Facebook and Amazon, Westworld’s bleak future is hardly surprising. Wood is still at the top of her game, a chilling manifestation of the consequences of humanity’s actions. Dolores is a picture-perfect robot, her physicality subtly distinguishing her from the rest of the world while she effortlessly takes on any human persona she wants on the fly. Largely, her actions are reactionary; as she says herself, “I’ve hurt so many people, I don’t want to hurt anyone else — unless they try to hurt me”. Her whole crusade is about the preservation of her kind, but along the way she takes some opportunities to dispense some righteous justice. Using a pair of high-tech glasses that can simulate reality, she forces Gerald to relive every terrible memory of him abusing his first wife and her ultimate demise. He insists it was an accident, but they both know the truth, one she lethally reminds him of when he “accidentally” dies in the very same place his wife did. When his wife comes up and sees her dead husband in the pool, Dolores tells her that she’s free. Her liberation of a woman trapped in an abusive relationship indicates that her perspective on humanity might just change in a big way when she realizes that the average person in the real world lives a similar life to hers in the park, following the same routines to please the obscenely wealthy. After the revelation of Incite and its giant sphere Rehoboam, able to analyze every person and determine their possible future pathways for them, the parallels between hosts and humans have become overt.

      <p class = "chicken">
        The ramifications of a world overrun by Rehoboam’s algorithmic determinism are shown through the introduction of a new main cast member: Caleb Nichols, played by Aaron Paul. Westworld’s season two finale “The Passenger” told us that humans are even simpler than hosts, but the season three premiere shows us how painfully true it is. Like most of us, Caleb follows the same schedule day after day with minor variations - the recurring shot of him waking up, along with the dreams he has of a defining moment in his life, further prove how robotic our lives are. Just like Dolores is analyzed by Bernard in Westworld’s pilot, Caleb answers instead to Francis (Kid Cudi! Exclamation mark!), a man who served in the army with him who was killed in action. Luckily for Caleb, the earpieces that everyone now uses (think of Spike Jonze’s Her) have a subscription that lets him hear his old friend’s voice. It’s really creepy, but for someone like Caleb who has difficulty reacclimating to the new world, it’s unsurprising he holds onto the past. For him, Incite has little to offer. After scanning through his prospects, an algorithm determines that a construction worker is the best job he’ll ever get, which is told to him through his earpiece by a robot named Sean. Desperate for money to support his sick mother, he frequents an app called “RICO”, which is basically Uber for criminals. With the company of Ash (Lena Waithe) and Giggles (Marshawn Lynch!), he commits minor crimes for cash but refuses to handle “personals” — that is, kidnapping or murder. Ironically, though, the package he delivers winds up containing the lethal dosages that Martin’s henchmen inject into Dolores to kill her. Even more ironically, he stops talking to “Francis” to find something real before running into Dolores. And yet, while the literal irony is apparent, she is more real than any human being, and the solution to what he’s been looking for. Humans cannot change, but hosts can. The tagline for this episode is “if one is stuck in a loop, it’s best to try walking in a straight line” — Dolores is Caleb’s only shot at derailing his circular path.

      <p class = "chicken">
        Back to Dolores. For some reason, she’s interested in tracking down the leader of Incite and operator of Rehoboam, briefly dating Liam (John Gallagher Jr.) to find out who it is. Last season, Dolores read the complete profiles of many people who’d visited Westworld. One of them was Gerald’s, and it’s not a long shot to guess she also studied up on Liam and his corporate fixer Martin Connells (Tommy Flanagan). She knows exactly how to coerce the young man, shifting from innocent and loving to authoritative and persistent to crack him down, only to be surprised by Martin. His last-minute rescue prevents Dolores from learning who’s running Incite now, but not before she learns that Liam’s effectively been shut out by someone else, unable to access his own data. Martin tells a startled Liam that Dolores sent a message to meet someone at the harbor, with a message above saying “I’ll lure him there”. While it appears she was talking about Liam, however, it becomes clear she was talking about Martin when a host version of him is the person that shows up at the rendez-vous. There was no way Dolores would’ve been sloppy enough to get caught like that; after luring Martin into an isolated area, she extracts the name she needs from him — Serac, the real creator of Rehoboam and the only one who knows what it’s strategizing anymore — and the host she’s created kills Martin and assumes his identity. Dolores has literally read every book she needs to in order to understand mankind, while we can’t even conceive of her processing power — simply put, humanity is doomed. It’s unclear whose control unit is within the Martin host: based on upcoming trailers it’s clear that Hector (or at least Rodrigo Santoro) will be appearing with Maeve (Thandie Newton) in next week’s “The Winter Line”, and Teddy (James Marsden) was sent into the Valley Beyond, so it’s unlikely to be him either. Dolores didn’t have many friends by the end of season two, so I’m curious who they’ll reveal to be inside of Charlotte Hale (Tessa Thompson) and Martin.

        Speaking of Hale, she makes a brief appearance in “Parce Domine” where she, as interim CEO, gives the green light to continue host production. It’s clear that someone else is within Hale’s body; the petulant fury in her eyes as she overhears the board members complaining about her is uncharacteristic of the stone-cold woman from previous seasons. Apart from her great clothes and more dynamic work from Thompson, robot-Hale also reveals that Bernard has been framed for the Delos massacre; furthermore, the world still thinks he’s a human.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Bernard himself is now in hiding, working in some sort of meat-packaging factory. Like in previous seasons, he struggles with violence. He tends to a poor animal with a broken leg, his compassion darkly contrasted with another observer who fetches someone to carve up the rest of it. It seems that Bernard can no longer trust himself to be himself; it’s been three months since Dolores left the park, but he’s still in fear that she’s controlling him. After all, she is the one who built him twice. Using a red button, Bernard has found a way to shift between his “Analysis” mode and his “Character” mode, the former comprising the technical aspects of who he is with the latter comprising his actual thoughts and emotions. Staying on the righteous path is impossible when the whole world is trying to kill you, so he’s found a way to dissociate between the robot who elegantly puts down his enemies and the moralist who’s trying to save humanity from extinction. Resultantly, he can run self-diagnostics that alternate between both states to interrogate himself and see if Dolores has been secretly tinkering with his head. As of now she hasn’t, but he knows she’s planning something big. He’s in no shape to stop her, not only because he might be compromised but because humanity is actively against him. Two co-workers realize who he is and attempt to take him out, forcing him to use his red button to switch into his analytical form and beat the crap out of them. Everyone is looking for him, while no one knows a rancher’s daughter from Sweetwater smuggled her way out of the park. Bernard’s got no chance against Dolores, so he takes a boat to Westworld to find someone who does. Read: Maeve.

      <p class = "chicken">
        Meanwhile, Dolores’ bloodbath winds down as she takes too many hits. After gracefully eliminating everyone who crosses her path — the self-driving motorcycle running someone over being particularly inspired - Dolores’ deep wounds cause her to collapse into the arms of Caleb. Their encounter takes place in season three, episode one, while Dolores collapses into William’s arms during a mirrored incident in season one, episode three. Needless to say, she’s about to turn his world upside down. Welcome back to Westworld.

      <p class = "chicken">
        All while this is happening, Rehoboam is watching all of them. In a disturbing sequence, Pom Klementieff’s unnamed character threatens Liam when she discovers aberrations in the data. Incite’s Rehoboam is supposed to anticipate the paths everyone will take — who could cause the system to diverge? The hosts, of course. In Beihai, China, in Los Angeles, USA, and in London, UREW(!), the system tracks “Hale” and Dolores’ moves across the world. Presumably, the mysterious Serac will be played by Vincent Cassel, and while he can’t pose a major threat to Dolores, Rehoboam can. Humanity stands no chance against the robot uprising, but they have a couple of robots up their sleeve that just might.

        Miscellaneous details:
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - This episode was directed by Jonathan Nolan and written by him and Lisa Joy. It’s the first time that’s happened since season one’s finale “The Bicameral Mind”.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - “Parce Domine” is an archaic Roman Catholic chant; derived from Latin, it goes “Spare, Lord, spare your people: Be not angry with us forever”. It’s also the name of an awesome painting by Adolphe Willette, which served as a major inspiration for this season.
        <!-- Code for the painting here -->
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Rehoboam was the son of Solomon the wise, who presided over a civil war. There’s a hint!
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - The drug everyone keeps taking that looks like the Eucharist seems to be some kind of hallucinogen that can actively be controlled by a terminal, which looks like a tablet that technicians use on hosts. Gerald sets it to a sunset, and the maniacal man that Giggles and Caleb knock out set it to something too strong for him to control. Angela was not kidding around in “Reunion” last season when she said everyone is scrambling to build the virtual world — anything to escape the real one.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - I’m not sure what U.R.E.W. is short for, but it certainly isn’t the United Kingdom. My best guess is the United Republic of England and Wales; that would mean Scotland’s broken off and the monarchy has dissolved. Goddamn.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Did not anticipate how fantastic Dolores’ scathing “Fuck off!” would be. Absolute legend. Also, “Hale” muting someone in real life is something I need stat.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Don’t believe it will happen, but if they reveal that the real world is actually just another park humanity made I will blow my brains out. If it turns out to be a simulation built by omniscient beings like the monolith in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, then maybe not. But blegh.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - The post-credits scene with Maeve suggests that she might’ve just woken up from the end of “The Passenger”. She touches her chest, remembering her wounds, but she can’t remember beating the guy tied to a chair in the room with her.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Next week’s episode is titled “The Winter Line”, directed by series veteran Richard J. Lewis (“Chestnut”, “Journey Into Night” and “Virtù e Fortuna”, admittedly some of my least favorite episodes of the show but still great) and written by Matthew Pitts and Lisa Joy. I suspect most of it will revolve around Maeve in War World, since the title refers to the Axis defense strategy of Italy during World War II.
