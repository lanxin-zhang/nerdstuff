        [Spoilers for <i>The Crown</i> season four episode five, "Fagan"]
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        "Fagan" has the makings of a great episode of <i>The Crown</i>, but too much lost in translation before
        the script makes it onto the screen. Consequently, some of the show's most powerful ideas end up being boiled down
        into a simply serviceable drama.
        The episode's structure and idea are pretty brilliant; a combination of 
        "Marionettes" and "Fairytale", "Fagan" anchors itself around an outsider's struggles with
        Crown and state policies. Previous episodes have already informed us about how hard Thatcher's policies
        have been on the economy, and they've shown us how little interest the prime minister has for those
        left behind in the wake of her tempestuous changes. As Michael Fagan suffers daily from her policies, Thatcher
        constantly enforces her own "bend or break" beliefs onto Britain. The result should be a harsh criticism of 
        the Iron Lady's callous rigidity and a large leap towards Elizabeth and Thatcher's big face-off, but Tom Brooke
        lacks the magnetism of <i>The Crown</i>'s key guest stars. The key concepts and scripting of "Fagan" are strong,
        but Brooke isn't Jane Lapotaire or John Heffernan; in a rather unusual turn of events for season four, the acting
        does a serious disservice to the writing. Brooke's flat performance robs "Fagan" of any real emotional weight, critically blunting
        its sharp attack on Thatcher.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        What director Paul Whittington still succeeds in visualizing from Jonathan D. Wilson and Morgan's script is its
        keen sense of the lower-middle class' strife during the troughs of 
        Thatcher's tenure as prime minister. Fagan is the perfect example of a typical guy whose life has completely
        fallen apart thanks to Thatcher's drastic policies: he lost his job thanks to her, which in turn made him lose his
        wife and kids. He's become a hollow shell of himself, identical to all the other jaded souls seeking jobseeker
        allowances. Observing Fagan and the world around him, away from all the majesty of Crown and state, effectively
        demonstrates the severity of Thatcher's decrees. It also shows how cruelly apathetic everyone is to the common
        person's plight, and how problematically unaware Elizabeth is of what's going on in the country. Fagan goes through
        several authorities for help, and no one offers any until he literally begs his Queen for help in an act of desperation
        that ultimately produces nothing but some introspective sympathy. Particularly relevant today during the pandemic,
        it's a damning reflection of institutions' lack of care for the people they supposedly serve.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Those frustrations are only exacerbated by Thatcher's constant presence—on the radio, on the television, and in 
        the newspaper, the prime minister repeats her "self-reliance" mantra. Whittington paints a dark dystopia
        with Thatcher around every corner; like Big Brother, she's an imposing, threatening presence without ever
        meeting Fagan or any of the other people affected by her policies. The state of the war is even more
        reminiscent of <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>; the Falklands War seems like little more than a three
        billion dollar advertisement for Thatcher, exciting the people over a war with no real implications
        for their lives. Winning the Falklands doesn't earn Fagan his job back, and it doesn't bring his kids
        back. Fagan's increasing desperation is elegantly paced; authority after authority turns him away,
        his ex's partner humiliates him again and again, and he stalks around Buckingham Palace for a glimmer
        of hope. 
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        The story's smooth progression doesn't build emotion like it ought to, though. Brooke's performance 
        feels empty; it's hard to feel anything about a character who often seems like a blank slate. What emotions
        he does show are often unpleasant and unsympathetic. Obviously, less likeable people don't deserve to lose
        everything that Fagan did, and the script's refusal to make him a completely
        innocent victim is commendably refreshing. However, Brooke's Fagan is crude and frequently violent in
        ways that make a sympathetic portrayal both challenging and necessary for the episode to work—he's the way
        he is because of Thatcher. However, his performance—wavering between unpleasant and vapid—makes
        his despondency feel more like an inevitable punishment than a cruel twist of fate. Heroes don't
        have to be likeable, victims don't either, but Brooke's bland performance is so thoroughly
        uninteresting that it elicits little sympathy outside of the text. 
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        His lack of screen presence diminishes Fagan's audience with the Queen, but Olivia Colman does a great
        job picking up the slack. Elizabeth's callback to Lord Altrincham's proposed reformations for the Crown 
        back in "Marionettes" echoes her eagerness to meet real people as they really are—not on their best
        behavior—and she slowly discerns that the intruder in her room is actually
        the perfect opportunity to see what life is really like for the common person. Colman manages what I 
        couldn't with Brooke's Fagan; with much better restraint than she managed in season three, we can see her 
        heart sink as she sees what Thatcher has been doing to the country. It's a perfect setup to Thatcher's
        victory parade, something Elizabeth is conspicuously not invited to; <i>The Crown</i> really struggles
        in season four with structure and pacing, but the growing rift between Queen and prime minister has 
        developed very smoothly.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        It's disappointing that the crux of the episode doesn't land so neatly. <i>The Crown</i>'s past few
        episodes have been its strongest in a while, and in some ways "Fagan" continues that trend with its 
        refreshing show-don't-tell approach to its political skewering of Thatcher. However, its lack
        of a compelling lead character or performance prevents the episode's individually great pieces from
        coming together. His future dried up with his money, despair suffocates Fagan; the every
        day man falls victim to a brutally uncaring system in the show's most poignant story to
        date. And yet "Fagan" feels almost wholly unaffecting, Brooke's stale central performance
        draining the script of its tragedy; on <i>The Crown</i>, the death of a Nazi
        sympathizer supersedes the death of a salesman.

        Miscellaneous details:
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — This episode was directed by Paul Whittington and written by Peter Morgan and Jonathan D. Wilson.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — The similarities I felt between "Fagan" and Todd Phillips' <i>Joker</i> did not do it many favors.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — This is the only episode of the season that Morgan shares a writing credit with someone. It's a shame
        because he's almost always great with a collaborator, someone to temper down his indulgences; 
        "Beryl" is a particularly great example, because
        his attempts at romance often invert my digestive processes.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — Elizabeth's description of Fagan as a Shakespearean fool is pretty much spot-on. 
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — Yikes, the royal family puts on gloves before touching the common folk.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — Fagan's fights were very obviously fake; <i>The Crown</i> isn't <i>Daredevil</i>, but you'd
        think they could still get a decent choreographer to stage the stunts.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — According to police reports, Fagan's plan was to slice his wrists in front of the queen. Jesus.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — Fagan pointing out the palace's drab decoration is a great comment on how archaic
        the monarchy is becoming: its rosy romanticism is peeling away with the paint.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — The use of the song "Boys Don't Cry" is rather clever; combined with Thatcher's endless lectures,
        it adds the most infuriating insult to injury.
      </p>
