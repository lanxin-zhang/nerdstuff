        [Spoilers for <i>The Crown</i> season four episode four, "Favourites"]
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        I'm a cynical guy with two brothers, so an episode that discusses parents' favorites is the 
        sort of demented stuff that gets me going. I agree with Philip and Thatcher's assessment: there's no way
        that parents can't have favorite kids. Everyone has favorite people, children are people, therefore everyone
        has favorite children. Logic isn't completely concrete, but whatever. 
        Anyways, "Favourites" is an episode that I've been long awaiting; it's our first look at
        Elizabeth and Philip's younger two children. "The Hereditary Principle" is a couple of episodes away,
        but it illustrates a very relevant dichotomy between the couple's older kids, Charles and Anne, and their younger ones, 
        Andrew and Edward. Their first two kids were their duty, an heir and a spare, and the second two were 
        born after Elizabeth and Philip renewed their commitment to one another (seems like a reference to 
        season two's "Lisbon", so props to the show for continuity). That reflects clearly in their behavior:
        Charles and Anne do their best to live
        up to the royal standard, or at least look like they are, while Andrew and Edward seem troublingly aloof.
        Intriguingly, the prim and proper Elizabeth likes the depraved and careless Andrew the most, while the 
        boyishly mischievous Philip favors Anne, 
        who's easily the most competent royal of the children.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        The episode is split into distinct parts: the Thatcher subplot where her son Mark goes missing, Elizabeth's
        conversations with each of her children, and discussions between Philip and Elizabeth near the beginning and 
        end of the episode about their kids. If it weren't for the Thatcher parts, this episode would've been a 
        total knockout, but they go egregiously overboard in their effort to criticize the prime minister. While
        "Fagan" will find clever, subtle ways to censure Thatcher's harsh policies, "Favourites" takes too much
        dramatic license to make an obvious point irritatingly clear. Even in this episode, Morgan effectively criticizes
        some of her viewpoints: she is adamant that women should be caretakers for their husbands in "The Balmoral Test", 
        but then blames them for their inability to achieve careers they have no time for in "Favourites". That's
        undercut by the argument between Thatcher and her daughter, which is painfully expository; Carol's flimsy characterization
        and contrived behavior makes it clear that she's just a conduit for Morgan to scream at the prime minister. 
      
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Furthermore, blaming Thatcher's decision to enter the Falklands War on her son's disappearance is nonsensical
        and lazy. <i>The Crown</i> is clearly implying she's too emotional in a state of power—something she accused
        all women of back in "Gold Stick"—but it doesn't add up with the stoic character we've seen on screen and 
        the real woman. Simply including the scene in which she cries in an audience with the Queen would've been
        sufficient to get the point across, but instead Morgan twists history and Thatcher's core identity to 
        criticize her. In reality, winning the Falklands War earned her widespread praise and skyrocketed her depleting
        popularity; it was a strategic move that showed Britain's strength, not a flailing act of desperation. Anderson
        is still great, but Thatcher's subplot is almost a total misfire—the sole bits I liked were Carol and Denis' conversation and 
        that Mark was shown to be the total dirtbag he seemed to be in real life.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        The rest of the episode is much better. Now that Philip and Elizabeth are terribly happy together, their
        banter is great; since the central trio (Philip, Elizabeth, and Margaret) is no longer the 
        center of all the drama, they're much more fun together. Of course, their children aren't quite sorted out:
        cleverly, the episode takes Thatcher's comment about favorites as an opportunity to explore Elizabeth as
        a mother. Not who her favorite is, though Philip is right that it's obviously Andrew, but her inability to
        express affection for her children. Her difficulty with expressing emotion was explored in "Aberfan", but 
        it felt a bit too abstract then—in "Favourites", we can see firsthand how distant she is with her children.
        Elizabeth is forced to ask Martin to prepare some information about her children for her, lest she seem 
        "uninformed, or cold, or remotely remote", before her conversations with each of them inadvertently
        reveals herself to be every one of those things.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        Anne's marriage is at the point of ruin, and Elizabeth has no advice for her except to wait things out
        and hope they get better. She gives Charles an overdue scolding for his treatment of Diana; the couple
        has been married for a year, his wife is pregnant and depressed—she literally sits in bed watching
        children's television all day—and all he can do is complain about her lack of "intellectualism" while
        his poetry recitation and boasts of Highgrove as his very own Shangri-La or Xanadu are enough to make
        even the proudest geek cringe. While Charles needs a reality check, their meeting completely lacks
        the empathy she expressed for him at the end of "Fairytale". Edward has become petty and vindictive
        after relentless bullying, and Andrew has become perverse and debauched; Elizabeth can do nothing
        but listen with horror as she realizes what her children are becoming. It's a crushing moment for her 
        as a mother, one that's been long coming; since season one, people have commented on her critical absence
        in her children's lives, and now she's forced to pay the consequences of that absence.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        What's most heartbreaking about it all is Elizabeth's confession that she couldn't even bathe her own
        kids; Olivia Colman doesn't have any explosive moments in the episode, but it's probably my favorite
        episode of hers. With each meeting she gets a little more rattled by all the time she's missed with her
        kids, how their lives have spiralled without any help from their parents, and it culminates in that
        gut-wrenching scene. "Favourites" has its fun with each of Elizabeth's conversations with her kids, slowly
        building towards the clear implication that Andrew is her favorite, but the piercing crux of the episode
        is about parenthood in general. Elizabeth wasn't able to be the mother she wanted to be for so many years,
        and with an empty nest she'll never have the chance to try again. 
        
        The ships full of soldiers headed for the Falklands are perhaps the best
        metaphor for Elizabeth's feelings throughout the episode: you try your best for your kids, and then
        you're forced to helplessly watch as they take off on their own, into a world full of danger and despair.

        Miscellaneous details:
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — This episode was directed by Paul Whittington and written by Peter Morgan.
      </p>


      <p class ="chicken">
        — Andrew's Richard III quip was very clever, if a little psychotic. Then again, I would not cry many
        tears if he dropped Charles by the end of this season.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — Philip's comment about Elizabeth's lack of self-awareness is weirdly endearing. Their idea of flirting
        in this show has always been kind of eccentrically sweet, though: "Coup" is a great example of that.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — I am glad that they held nothing back with their depiction of Andrew, given what's come to light recently.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — The urine disguised as chilled wine was absolutely disgusting, but I agree with Edward: the dedication to the joke
        was commendable.
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — Philip, Anne and Margaret are usually the quippy ones, but Elizabeth is deviously witty sometimes.
        After Charles goes on a pretentious tirade about his new home and the single idea controlling it all, 
        her dry comment that "the big idea is you" immediately drags him back down to Earth.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — Anne's irritation with the public's adoration for Diana is very interesting. It shows how
        society punishes women for not conforming to very narrow standards while praising those who do,
        which ends up pitting them against one another.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — Funnily enough, Olivia Colman played Carol Thatcher—the less loved child of Margaret and Denis—back
        in <i>The Iron Lady</i>. Also, since I don't remember if I've mentioned it, Helena Bonham Carter
        once played Queen Elizabeth. Not Elizabeth II, but her mother. Aka her mother on this show. The way
        that British actors are cast in a dozen historical dramas apiece never ceases to amuse me.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — Without hesitation, Philip declares his favorite is Anne. That is the correct answer.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — It's not really the actor's fault, but I couldn't take Prince Edward seriously at all when I realized
        he was Claire's stepson Jake in <i>Fleabag</i>. "Where's Claire?"
      </p>
