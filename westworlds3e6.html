        [Spoilers for <i>Westworld</i> season three episode six, "Decoherence"]
      </p>
      <p class = "chicken">
        It's tedious constantly renaming Tessa Thompson's character, but it only seems appropriate that she's now called Charlores. Fiery pun aside, it's more accurate for Charlotte's name to take more precedence in Thompson's incarnation of Dolores considering how the Delos CEO's life has begun to consume her own identity. Charlores isn't the only character with a lot on their plate this week; with the exception of Aaron Paul's Caleb, every main character returns for "Decoherence", an episode that blends table-setting with gory action to swiftly propel <i>Westworld</i> to its season three conclusion. Hopefully, Jeffrey Wright will finally get something to do by then.
      </p>


      <p class = "chicken">
        At least this episode returns some focus to William (Ed Harris). After being sent to one of Serac's Inner Journeys Recovery facilities, we watch as the Man In White's pitch-black cynicism overwhelms his fellow patients during a session of group therapy. "I think that humanity is a thin layer of bacteria on a ball of mud hurtling through the void", he says, delivering the show's most evocative monologue in recent memory. "We're maggots eating a corpse." It's only a tad less brutal than Mike's brief venture into therapy on <i>Better Call Saul</i> (an excellent series whose fifth season just wrapped), and it doesn't do much to lead him to any sort of recovery.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        His private therapy session isn't much better, either. A Dr. Lang asks him if he feels guilt about surviving the park while his daughter didn't (clearly, the public and likely everyone isn't aware of what William did in "Vanishing Point") and recommends him AR therapy, often given to veterans suffering from PTSD. Considering the flashes we saw of Caleb's past last episode, not to mention an offhand remark he made about being sent to war by Liam, it seems increasingly likely he also spent some time at one of Serac's facilities. It was probably just as ineffective for him as William, who declares that "I don't need any therapy to confront the truth". With utter candor, he openly reveals how he killed his daughter after losing his grip on reality, and admits that he belongs in a coffin, not an institution.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Of course, little of that actually translates to Dr. Lang, whose Incite profile is released during the session — she's revealed to be an opioid addict who has had numerous affairs with clients, and her husband tells her he's left with the kids. She abruptly ends the session, and he's transferred into a Mesa-looking room in which he's given a drip like Caleb's. A blood test taken on him reveals an unknown protein — it isn't proof he's a host, it's actually a tracker from the thing Charlores poked him with in "The Mother of Exiles". It goes unnoticed by the sparse staff, most of whom have left (recalling the scene in "Reunion" when Mesa body shop workers wonder why everyone's gone), so he's taken to the AR room, passing by Dr. Lang's office as she hangs herself out of despair. It won't be long before Incite's revelations tear the facility apart, but in the meantime he's given AR glasses by a Dr. Alpert, who promises to monitor from another room.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        When William becomes aggravated upon seeing a child version of himself and a memory of his furious father threatening him, the technicians realize that something's wrong with his implant. The reason isn't clear, but he chews off someone's finger before they successfully sedate and remove him from the room. He awakens to find himself in another dream; Major Craddock (Jonathan Tucker), the Confederado who terrorized Las Mudas in "The Riddle of The Sphinx", leads William to another group therapy session, but this time it's with several incarnations of himself: his child self, Jimmi Simpson's "Reunion" iteration of Young William, the Man In Black, and the troubled William from "Vanishing Point". Hosting the session is none other than James Delos (Peter Mullan). For once, William's at a loss for words: "Shit," he says.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Disappointed in what becomes of him in the future, the child version of William prompts them all to argue. They deny responsibility for the actions that they've taken and the Forge's suggestion that humans have no free will. "Vanishing Point" tuxedo William suggests that the park actually made him the violent man of today, but it turns out that his father's previous rage was because of a fight William got into with another boy at school. They declared William worthless and his father a drunk, so he broke the kid's arm and knocked out three of his teeth — unrepentant, child William screams that he wish he'd have taken out the rest of them.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        The twist is too quick and uncommitted to making itself work, but Delos' remark that Williams father "used to say he drank because of you" hits hard. Considering how he destroyed the Delos family tree, it's clear he's poison to everyone around him. All the Williams are disheartened, fearing the suggestion that they really have no control, but his direct confronation with his past lets William come full circle with his questions about his own reality. "If you can't tell, does it matter?" was the pitch that made him fall in love with Westworld in season one, it was the pitch that led Delos to seek immortality in season two, and in season three it's what liberates him from his inconsumable paranoia. "I know what I have to do", he says, suddenly confident again.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Literally purging himself of his past, William murders every past version of himself, embracing the past for what it was and starting brand new with a clean slate (the full white costume's symbolism is apparent here again). "I'm the good guy", he says, before the simulation collapses when Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) and Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) discover him. The facility appears to be abandoned, and he's been inside the AR world for far longer than he was supposed to. Oddly, he was supposed to be removed from the room but wakes up in an identical one — is it the same one, or was he just moved? And more importantly, if I can't tell, does it matter? Yes, because it might be a continuity error or something crazy about to happen.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Anyway, it seems probable that Bernard and Stubbs got the coordinates of William's location from Charlores, who had another standout episode. It's an honest shame this season wasn't twelve episodes or more; a season with <i>The Americans</i> spy vibes where Charlores slowly unravelled Keri Russell-style would've been amazing, but even with only two important starring appearances this season, her arc is one of the most promising. Taking Nathan to Jake's home in San Francisco, she asks him to look after their son while she goes to work. There's a surprisingly touching moment between Charlores and Jake when he admits he wanted to read his profile to understand their separation, before deciding it was up to them to decide their own fates.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Sweet as that might be, there's a dark circle painting in the background, overtly threatening his heartwarming outlook on the future. Charlotte meets Brompton, one of the Delos board members, on the way to the privatization meeting, and he's quickly killed by Serac's (Vincent Cassel) goons, meaning she doesn't have enough votes to go private. Serac calls and reveals he knew Brompton was planning going to start a privatization vote, and says he's closing in on Dolores as they speak, something true in many ways. Charlores is in danger, and by extension her new family is too.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Charlores calls to tell Dolores Prime (Evan Rachel Wood) that Delos has been taken over by Serac, and she's told to collect all the host-making data they need from Delos before she leaves. Charlores isn't happy about it; unlike Tommy Flanagan's Tinlores, who was still very much like Dolores Prime, she isn't so willing to give up her life, especially when Dolores isn't putting herself in that kind of danger. To make matters even more complicated, Charlores has become attached to Hale's family, describing them as her own before saying "I'm already changed. I can feel myself slipping away from you."
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Still, Charlores follows her orders and greets Serac as he arrives to command the destruction of all of Delos' data, apart from three assets (read: host control units) to be sent transferred to him through satellite. Those hosts are spared at the behest of Maeve (Thandie Newton), whose body is being reprinted after being killed by Hiroyuki Sanada's Mulores in "The Mother of Exiles". In a simulation of Westworld, she dismisses Serac's attempts to win her over with offers of reuniting her with her daughter, instead asking for more of her kind to join the battle against Dolores. Maeve herself begins training in War World, beating up droves of Nazis to prepare herself for her next showdown against Dolores.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        After her bloody warmup session, Maeve reunites with simulation-Lee (Simon Quarterman) for a little chat in the bar. Quickly, she realizes that they've been moved to a new location — using her powers in the simulation, she sees through the cameras in the outside world and realizes that Serac has kept his word, bringing back three hosts to ally with her. One, of course, is Hector (Rodrigo Santoro), who she restores to his true self inside the simulation with her. For the first time since "The Passenger", they're truly reunited. Her friends aren't all that Maeve sees through the cameras; it turns out the Tinlores control unit survived the blast and was picked up by Incite.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        In the classic room where Dolores and Arnold held their season one conversations, Maeve and Dolores meet once again. Each of Wood and Newton's interactions is fascinating: Dolores helps Maeve onto the path of escape in season one's "Chestnut", their ideologies clash in season two's "Reunion" and "Les Écorchés", and in this season they're completely poised against one another. Both have come into a lot of power; Dolores has several copies of herself and Maeve can control hosts with her mind, and neither trusts the other with the survival of their species. Though they share a brief moment of companionship when they admit they'll inevitably fight, it's quickly soured by Charlores' escape.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        After gathering the board, Serac tells them all what Maeve likely told him: there are several Doloreses, and there's likely one within Delos. He asks that every employee be thoroughly tested to see if they've broken from Rehoboam's predictions, so Charlores quickly begins planning her exit. She collects and sends all the necessary host-making data to Dolores along with William's location (used by Bernard and Stubbs), but then learns that three hosts besides Maeve and been recovered and that Tinlores' pearl survived the explosion and was discovered by Incite. Concerned, she calls Jake and tells him to be careful before she comes to pick him and Nathan up. However, she's intercepted by a board member who reveals that Serac's already called another board meeting.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Of course, he already knows that the host in Delos is Charlores. Why?  "The real Charlotte Hale never would have taken the time to check on her son", he says. Imagine being exposed for being too nice of a person. While I disagree with the impression Serac gives that Charlotte didn't care about her family ("The Absence of Field" is very clear about that), that ain't a good look. Serac was watching her ever since he landed, and ensured the data she collected was useless. With all the Delos hosts being torched to crisp and Mulores having no data to build any new ones, it looks like we'll be waiting on Dolores' robot army for a while.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Serac may have prepared for the occasion with a trap, but so did Charlores; she tricks the security team by poisoning the room with a seemingly harmless container, and though she can't kill the holographic Serac she begins running for the host production room. At the same time, Tinlores warns Maeve that Dolores likely prepared for a situation in which they would fight, and prepared to act accordingly. Correctly, Tinlores predicted Dolores would try to stop Maeve from getting new allies, proven as Charlores enters the host production room, executing her enemies before crushing Hector's control unit pearl and killing him for the last time.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        The scene is admittedly anticlimactic: Hector barely appeared in this season, and frankly the same is true of Maeve. However, Thandie Newton's complete breakdown is a performative tour-de-force that finally gives real depth to her upcoming fight against Dolores. The look of bestial rage she directs at Tinlores before her control unit disappears is absolutely terrifying — when she finally meets Dolores again, they'll no longer be begrudging enemies. After Charlores flees the room, Maeve's body finishes printing and she watches as a new form rises out of the host-making vats, ready to exact some serious vengeance.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Though what Charlores does to Hector is terrible, it's hard not to feel bad for her after what happens to her at the end of the episode. After calling on one of the Riot Control robots from previous episodes for some assistance, she smashes through Delos' security before collecting her family and trying to escape. They're terrified, obviously, because she's covered in blood and bullet holes, but she promises to keep them safe right before the car explodes and instantly kills Jake and Nathan. One of Incite's men promptly leaves the scene, deed done, but Charlores still crawls out of the wreckage, her flesh severely burnt. She's had problems uniting her Dolores identity with her Hale identity, literally tearing her skin open, but watching her human family die in a completely wrecked form, it's clear she's becoming something entirely apart from either of them.

        Miscellaneous details:
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - This episode was directed by Jennifer Getzinger and written by Lisa Joy and Suzanne Wrubel.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Tessa Thompson's costume this week was great, but it was also the one she wore in episode one. Not sure if it's because it was so good or if it may collaborate to a mirror world theory.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Throughout the episode, Charlores seems close to cutting herself again, and when Serac lands at Delos she traces her chest in the same circular pattern she carved into herself. What this means I don't know, but the key shape of her wounds might mean she holds the coveted encryption key. Not my theory, but it's possible.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - When Charlores takes Nathan home, they see some people spray painting a maze onto a wall. Who knows why they know about the Westworld symbol for consciousness, I think it's just a visual bridge between the park and the real world.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Thandie Newton and Ed Harris obviously killed it, because they appeared and their presences always mean perfection. Still, along with the largely irrelevant Bernard, they comprise all the story's main characters of the first two seasons and they've barely anything to do so far. I'm worried they'll all lose their Emmy nominations this season, so <i>Westworld</i> better give them some great material in these last two episodes.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Continuing to be impressed by Tessa Thompson, who is showing more range on this show than she has in her entire career.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Don't read this if you'd like to be surprised by who Maeve's allies turn out to be next week, because I know for sure. Turned away if you don't wanna know? Cool. Unsurprisingly, one of them is Angela Sarafyan's Clementine. Clementine's host ID is CP0124831983, which is seen on Charlores' screen when she looks at the list of hosts being printed. I don't know about the others, but cast photos suggest Clifton Collins Jr.'s Lawrence might return, which wouldn't surprise me considering she helped him remember what William did to him. The other likely option is Hanaryo, aka Shogun World Armistice, because her actress Tao Okamoto was seen at the premiere.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Another personal attack from this week's episode tagline: "Do a lot of people tell you that you need therapy?"
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - As someone with an identical twin brother, I'd like to see the day one of his friends speaks to me and also deduces it's not him because of how great I'm being.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Next week’s episode is titled "Passed Pawn", directed by Helen Shaver and written by Gina Atwater. A passed pawn is a pawn with no enemy pawns along its path to becoming queen, giving a small piece the potential for great power. I'm guessing it's Caleb, but I'm secretly hoping it's Bernard so Jeffrey Wright can actually do something this season. On another note, season's numerous writers and directors with little experience have frustrated me before, but Gina Atwater co-wrote "The Riddle of The Sphinx" with Jonathan Nolan, still one of the show's best episodes. So, best of luck to them.
