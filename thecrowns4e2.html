        [Spoilers for <i>The Crown</i> season four episode two, "The Balmoral Test"]
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        While I do appreciate that <i>The Crown</i> is willing to depict the royal family 
        in a less flattering light, their negative portrayal in "The Balmoral Test" is
        too sudden and too extreme to 
        completely work. It's an exceptionally crafted episode with a lot of inspiration, but
        Peter Morgan seems to forget that the show's royals are characters, not their real 
        life counterparts. Therefore, even though the Balmoral Test is a real thing that's as 
        daunting as the episode suggests, the way that the royals behave is detrimentally
        uncharacteristic of them. Episodes like "Marionettes" have 
        focused on the family's flaws from an outside perspective, but they never came 
        at the expense of reason. As per usual, Morgan's fault is that he overemphasizes details
        that require delicate nuance. "The Balmoral Test" is a solid villain-Thatcher 
        origin story and big step forward for Charles and Diana's romance, but it
        fumbles a valuable opportunity for the show to explore the royals from an outside perspective.
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        I'll start with what worked with the episode, because I'm worried my complaints about 
        the show make it sound much worse than it is. It's still a good show, and "The Balmoral Test"
        succeeds on many fronts. Diana shines during her visit to Balmoral, but the
        flaws in her relationship with Charles are expertly laid throughout the hour. As eye-rolling
        as Charles' brief Verdi lecture to Diana is (and that's coming from someone who can draw
        a family tree of House Targaryen from memory), it reinforces two key issues in their relationship. Charles is a huge
        art snob while Diana is a normal human being, and the way that he speaks to her makes 
        their age difference very apparent: he's not necessarily condescending (yet), but it's
        clear he sees her as a child rather than his peer. His awkwardly polite
        farewell to Diana after her phenomenal performance at Balmoral (a great scene for
        Josh O'Connor, whose Charles seems caught between patting her on the head and running 
        for his life)—plus the fact that he literally describes her as a child to Camilla later—only
        further prove that any union between them will be a total mess.
        
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        Of course, any reservations that Charles might have himself amount to little. His entire
        family—Anne, Margaret (haha Ann-Margaret someone save me), Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, 
        and Philip most of all—is absolutely blown away by her, and the wishes of the monarchy 
        must always come first. What's refreshing in this season of <i>The Crown</i> is that, 
        more often than not, the demands of the Crown are calamitous. While past seasons explored
        characters' sacrifices to succeed in their roles, season four proves that sometimes the
        shoe just can't fit. Diana is obviously a much more compelling choice than the married
        Camilla, and yet Charles and Camilla ultimately find happiness after the prince's marriage
        to Diana completely falls apart. As the times change, the monarchy's values are becoming
        increasingly archaic, and it's becoming toxic to its own people. The unanimous support
        for Diana feels thrilling in the moment, but it's even more dangerous than the unanimous dislike the
        family shows for Thatcher. 
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        To be fair, Thatcher doesn't care much for the royals either. The contrast between her
        contempt for the royal family and Diana's total adoration for it
        shows how naive and unprepared the younger woman is. "The Balmoral Test" serves Diana
        well that way, but it comes up a bit short-handed with Thatcher. The portrayal of the prime
        minister herself, a zealous workalcoholic with no interest in pleasant banalities, works 
        quite well in contrast to the royal family; however, the family sometimes feels far too out
        of character for the whole thing to succeed. Sometimes, it sticks. Princess Margaret's 
        criticisms of Thatcher are exactly what I'd expect, and I'm pleased that Morgan hasn't forgotten
        how intimidatingly snobbish she can be. However, the way that Elizabeth is portrayed really pushes it. Episodes like "Marionettes" and "Scientia Potentia Est" have
        shown her to be very self-aware, but she acts absurdly ignorantly throughout "The Balmoral Test".
        Morgan is trying to show how she and the other members of the family have internalized their
        weird rituals to the point where they no longer think they're strange, but the harsh
        depictions of the royals are too abrasive to make it work. Elizabeth, who seemed determined
        to win over the first female prime minister of Britain last episode, is utterly devoid of both hospitality and common sense
        as she sends Thatcher off during the stalking. Even if she did that in real life (Ron Howard: she didn't), it
        doesn't feel like Elizabeth as we've seen her on the show.

      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Consquently, "The Balmoral Test" fails to be the introspective episode of
        <i>The Crown</i> that it promised to be; honestly, that brief shot of the whole family watching
        Charles in last season's "Imbroglio" was much more impressionable on that front than this entire
        episode. At the very least, Thatcher's struggles at Balmoral produce a great performance
        from Anderson. While she made a big debut in "Gold Stick", "The Balmoral Test" offers 
        her many opportunities for subtlety that she performs excellently. She earns the name
        "Iron Lady" in her steely confrontations with her Cabinet, which makes her vulnerability
        amidst the royals an impressive shift for the actress. Thatcher wasn't born with wealth
        or a great name, and it's hard to forget as Anderson, witheringly cold, dismisses the royals
        as unintelligent, vapid snobs. Corrin is equally fantastic in a totally opposite role: much
        like the royals, it's hard not to be swept away by her sheepish charm. Her dynamic with
        Menzies is great, and it's a strong setup for their devastating showdown in "War".
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        The rest of the cast also does great work to offset the jarring writing, but the ultimate
        product comes up a little short. Even at its best, the lacking setup makes
        "The Balmoral Test" falter; Diana and Thatcher are only beginning to shed their caricatures, and the 
        sudden shift in the royals' portrayal is gratingly wedged into the show. In the grand
        scheme of things, it's one of the better plot-driven episodes. However, what it does for
        narrative momentum is downplayed by its limited and mercurial characterization, making one of
        Morgan's harsher critiques of the royal family feel less like <i>Gosford Park</i> and more
        like the <i>Downton Abbey</i> movie. Unlike Thatcher and her Cabinet, <i>The Crown</i> lacks
        the proper foundations for such a spontaneous reshuffling of its core ensemble.

      <p class="chicken">
        Miscellaneous details:
      </p>

      <p class="chicken">
        — "The Balmoral Test" was directed by Paul Whittington and written by Peter Morgan.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — Still waiting to feel one way or another about Camilla, but Fennell isn't really doing 
        anything for me. Am excited to see <i>Promising Young Woman</i>, though.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — Philip and Anne have the best dynamic in the family, hands down. There is not one scene
        between them that isn't great, and "The Balmoral Test" has several.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — The stag can symbolize many things, one being the family's favor, but I like the fact 
        that it's killed as Charles and Diana's marriage nears. Stag parties and the death of a 
        bachelor and all that.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — Diana's grandmother is a nightmare. Apparently she was actually concerned about Diana going to
        Balmoral in real life, but I'm okay with her portrayal in this episode because it pays off well
        in "Fairytale".
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — Thatcher's husband Denis is great comedic relief, and her reaction as he reads aloud in bed 
        was hilarious.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — "Tippity toppity, down with the Nazis." — Elizabeth, the Queen Mother
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        — Thatcher's description of her Cabinet members as "wet" would've been more interesting
        if Anne hadn't said the exact same thing last season. Same with the 
        "country must change from top to bottom" thing Thatcher says in this episode that
        had already been said in "Gold Stick".
      </p>

      <p class ="chicken">
        — I get so irrationally annoyed every time I see Mark. I know a lot happens between episodes,
        but the way they just tossed him into the show and pretended he was there the whole time—without
        giving him a single line—frustrates me to death. Also, where are Margaret's kids?
