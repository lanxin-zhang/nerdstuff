        [Spoilers for <i>Westworld</i> season three episode two, “The Winter Line”]
      </p>
      <p class = "chicken">
        Well, Thandie Newton better start writing that Emmy speech. Following a brief appearance in last week's post-credits scene, Newton's Maeve is back in full force in "The Winter Line". After "Parce Domine" took us through the sleek, futuristic aesthetic of the real world while retaining the same <i>Westworld</i> spirit, "The Winter Line" returns us to familiar ground with a sharp change in tone. Unlike the typical melancholy and introspection the show excels at, it's surprisingly fun, even silly. It seems that explorations of different parks seem to encourage <i>Westworld</i> to go a little crazy, which is quite refreshing this far into the story. While the show is quite good at standalone episodes, though, it really needs to start picking up steam. Considering a quarter of the season is already over, the episode's little plot advancement is admittedly frustrating. Nevertheless, "The Winter Line" is a slick spin on the old <i>Westworld</i> and another outstanding showcase from Thandie Newton.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        In a stunning cold open that tops Emily's "Virtù e Fortuna" entrance, Maeve's journey begins right after the post-credits scene. She's in War World, a recreation of Nazi-occupied Italy and Delos' third theme park. It may seem a bit cliché to have a Nazi storyline, but <a href = "https://lanxin-zhang.github.io/nerdstuff/westworldcharacters">I'm sure this explanation of Delos' theme parks will persuade you otherwise.</a> In fact, War World is particularly appropriate for Maeve, considering it's an espionage, logic-driven park and she's the smartest of the bunch. Quickly, Hector (Rodrigo Santoro) returns to whisk her to freedom. Of course, as he's in War World, his name is no longer Hector, it's... Ettore.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        When she asks him what's going on, he gives her the gist of their current War World narrative: they're Allied spies who have acquired an important map that must be sent back in order to win the war. The townspeople have been rounded up in the square (think Sweetwater), and the Germans are trying to find out who stole the map. After slipping past the assembled army with absurd ease, it's revealed that Maeve's lost her powers when some guardsmen refuse to obey her commands. Still, they're easily taken out — Maeve shoves her suicide pill into a guy's eye, because she's classy like that — and Hector reveals that he's arranged for a helicopter to take them out of the parks and finally to freedom. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned for the lovely couple: the entire crew aboard the plane is dead, and when Hector calls Maeve "Isabella", it becomes depressingly clear he didn't have a escape plan, because he doesn't even remember her: he was just following his narrative. Once again, escape is snatched away from Maeve at the final moment; despairing, she blows her own brains out to escape her enslavement.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Of course, host suicide is a little bit more complicated than human suicide. Maeve awakens in the War World Mesa, where Felix (Leonardo Nam) and another human are patching up the hole in her head. Though he's clearly aware she's awake, he seems completely uninterested in speaking to her. After they leave, she sneaks past most of the body shop workers ridiculously easily, only for Sylvester (Ptolemy Slocum) to spot her and call QA surveillance. Sure, the two had their problems, but his willingness to sell her out after their experiences together in season two seems a bit unbelievable.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        As security closes in on Maeve, she opts to manually lobotomize herself rather than continue to be their pawn, but not before she delivers some sardonic barbs: "I understand the nature of my reality. Lying to you is practically second nature. And I would most assuredly hurt a living thing", she mocks before she prepares to kill herself, only for Lee Sizemore (Simon Quarterman) to appear and stop her. Yay, he's back! He managed to survive six bullet wounds, and limps around on a cane. Dismissing the security team with minimal effort, Lee tells Maeve that he's brought them to War World because it's close to The Forge, where her daughter escaped into robot heaven. There's still a chance she can access the system and reunite with her daughter. Maeve returns to her loop and quickly diverges towards Westworld, but she's sadly unable to persuade Hector/Ettore to follow her. Alongside Sizemore, she rides back to Westworld.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Now would be a good time to mention the B-plot of the episode, Bernard's journey back to Westworld. A couple of digressions: first of all, it turns out that the Mandarin-speaking people Bernard hitched a ride with last episode were actually on Palawan Island, inhabited by Filipinos. <i>Westworld</i>, therefore, must be predicting that by 2058, China will have taken control over the island. Also, Paramount Ranch, the set that <i>Westworld</i> filmed on for its first two seasons, was razed to the ground in a wildfire. The showrunners made use of that post-apocalyptic look for Bernard's return to the Western theme park, which has clearly been weathered by Dolores' reckoning. He enters the Mesa, passes by the creepy clones of himself discovered last season, only to find Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) sitting in a chair with a gun, blood splattered behind him.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        While we know he's a host, Bernard doesn't, and is promptly shocked when he begins sputtering back to life. It turns out that after completing his core directive, protecting the hosts in the park, he chose to decommission himself by shooting the explosive charge in his neck. By this point in the episode, several things are pretty unbelievable, but this little detail is what probably bothered me most. A robot missed his own spine? Really? And if the charge was so easy to detonate, what would stop guests from accidentally triggering it? Complaints aside, it gives Hemsworth the opportunity to outact his brothers' entire filmographies in a minute — his depiction of a glitching Stubbs trying to speak with a hole in his throat is surprisingly brilliant. Since Bernard's come back, he patches up Stubbs and uses him to open up cold storage and find Maeve among the decommissioned hosts.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Contrary to their belief, Maeve is actually with Sizemore in The Forge. He expects her to revive the system, but she only ever encountered the virtual Eden from above ground, not here. Lee is confused, but he's clearly also very educated on the subject: "your daughter and all the other hosts are in an encrypted world somewhere — you must have sent them there", he insists. Quickly, she deduces that it was Dolores who sent the hosts to an unknown location, yet Lee continues pressing her for the coordinates — something is clearly wrong. "What's gotten into you?" She asks, and the answer is: love, apparently.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        In an awful twist, Lee confesses he loved her all along, even declaring he survived a rain of bullets because they were no match for his love for her. In an episode that's already pretty bizarre, it really is the last straw. It is for Maeve, too, who then realizes that Lee isn't real. Like the James Delos host, he begins breaking down — again, the malfunction acting is impeccable — as Bernard and Stubbs discover Maeve in the Mesa with her control unit missing. Someone has taken her somewhere, but nowhere real: as the Sizemore host glitches, the very world begins disintegrating, and the show's aspect ratio shifts into the wider lens of The Cradle and The Forge, it's clear she's been in a simulation this whole time.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Another digression: thank God for that twist, because the episode was deeply uncomfortable by that point. It was very wise for Richard J. Lewis to helm this episode, because he's been a director on the show since the beginning. Subtly, he keeps every scene on the edge of plausiblity while ensuring every encounter Maeve has is a little bit off, even though it's not immediately apparent why. Logically, the twist was clearly coming: barely anyone notices Maeve in War World or The Mesa, Lee is back after obviously dying, and on top of that, he knows about The Forge, something he clearly didn't know about in seasons one and two. After escaping War World and The Mesa, Maeve prepares to break out of her digital prison.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Dissecting and escaping worlds is sort of Maeve's jam. In season one, she was the chaotic force that wreaked havoc on park security, swiftly learning its systems before shutting them all down. "The Winter Line" is much like Maeve's season one arc in that sense, but it's much more brisk and spirited. Hanging around with robot Lee, who's in the middle of an existential crisis and has been coded to be obsessed with her, the show is actually funny for the first time since "Akane No Mai". To crash the simulation, Maeve begins overloading the system by giving it impossible commands. She causes the system to glitch by asking two technicians to solve for the square root of negative one, demonstrated as a statue (of herself on Sizemore's desk, a lovely detail) she throws freezes in the air.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Afterwards, she begins stuffing every Nazi soldier's pockets with the map that Hector/Ettore carried earlier in the episode. When she returns again to her loop, the technicians still poring over her math problem (has something ever been more relatable?), she makes every Nazi reveal their very own maps in the square, causing them to fire on one another before the simulation fails and they all freeze. Again, props to Richard J. Lewis for his best direction on the series yet, using a gorgeous tracking shot to unveil the aftermath of Maeve's machinations. Unlike freezes in the real world, simulation freezes keep moving bullets, falling people, and splattering blood in place. Except for Lee, who's only frozen because he's scared shitless. Now that she's overriden the system, she says a final sweet goodbye to him before operating a host called Harriet to take her control unit out of the simulation and escape.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        While taking control of a robot world is child's play for Maeve by this point, it's unfortunately much harder to make it far in the real world. An exceptionally well done escape sequence sees the Harriet bot taking out human security guards as it runs with Maeve's control unit. The sequence is tense and emotional, particularly as Harriet is gunned down by several armed men and drops Maeve's control unit. Even in the real world, she's still humanity's prisoner.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        In Bernard's storyline, things are still pretty upbeat. As he and Stubbs enter the upper floors of Park Four's Mesa, it's mentioned that a lot of technicians are just waiting around to see if they get fired. In one of the rooms, two technicians discuss dissecting Delos merchandise and selling it to a buyer in Costa Rica, and they are no other than <i>Game of Thrones</i> showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. And the merchandise they're going to cut up? <i>Drogon</i>. If that isn't a crazy enough reference yet, the Costa Rican group interested in the dragon corpse is almost certainly InGen, founded by John Hammond, aka the creator of Jurassic Park. George R. R. Martin loves <i>Westworld</i> and wanted Westerosworld, while Michael Crichton wrote the novel <i>Jurassic Park</i> and both wrote and directed the film <i>Westworld</i>. It's a clever homage that works on several levels, indicative of the show's lighter heart this season.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        Bernard searches for Maeve using the park's tablets, but it's clear she's no longer within the realm of the parks. Since he's in the midst of technology that he didn't create himself, he takes the opportunity to run a diagnostic on himself again to ensure Dolores didn't implement secret code in him. A couple of Delos security members see Bernard, forcing Stubbs to knock them out, but not before they call for back-up, resulting in <i>Westworld</i> turning into a farcical comedy when Stubbs follows the Hemsworth tradition and chases off a bunch of submachine gun wielders with an axe. It barely makes sense; yes, he's their boss and he's suddenly thwacking all of them, but that doesn't justify how dumb they are. Weirdly though, it kind of works. Bernard is forced to conclude his patch early, but while he seems troubled he gives little away about what he discovered.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        What he does tell us is that he's headed for Liam Dempsey Jr. (John Gallagher Jr.), who Dolores read about extensively in The Forge. To prevent Stubbs from just killing himself and leaving Bernard alone, the latter host reprograms Stubbs' core drive to now focus on protecting Bernard Lowe. "You wanted my help, you could've just asked for it", Stubbs says, and Bernard smiles for the first time in two seasons. It seems like they're in their own buddy movie bubble, and right now it totally works.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        In the land of less fun, Maeve awakens in the real world, in the house she just attempted to escape through Harriet. Here, she meets the enigmatic Engerraund Serac, who is indeed played by Vincent Cassel. He reveals that Rehoboam has already predicted mankind's upcoming defeat against the hosts; he tracked down Maeve's control unit and interrogated her using the simulation, assuming she was the cause of the divergences that intermittently marked "Parce Domine" and "The Winter Line". Instead, he discovers it's Dolores who's causing them (Bernard is too, but he doesn't know that) and asks Maeve to track her down and kill her. Of course, Maeve cares less for humanity than her own kind, so she promptly takes a knife and prepares to sink it in his heart, only to be frozen by the push of a button. At that moment, the title "The Winter Line" takes on a different meaning, one much sadder.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
         A winterline is an atmospherical phenomenon in which a second horizon appears when warm air is trapped under cold air. That's the perfect summation of what Maeve's story has been throughout <i>Westworld</i>, and particularly in this episode: while Maeve topples wall after wall, escaping Westworld and reaching The Door, she never quite reaches her goal. She steps off of the train, she dies before the Valley vanishes, and in this episode alone she breaks through several simulations before finding herself a captive, yet again, in the real world. As blazingly determined as she is, the cold certainty of yet another prison inevitably trails her into the horizon.

        Miscellaneous details:
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - This episode was directed by Richard J. Lewis and written by Lisa Joy and Matthew Pitts.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - For the scenes in War World, <i>Westworld</i> was shot in Bethulu, Spain, a breathtaking little village with striking similarities to Italy. Major props to the location managers on the show.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - A detail I maybe should've mentioned in the overall recap, but couldn't find a place for it: Stubbs <i>coughed</i> up the bullet he shot into himself. Jeessus.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        -  Maeve spitting facts about humanity: "if there's one thing I know about human nature, it's that your stupidity is only eclipsed by your laziness."
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Something I picked up that may not amount to anything: Bernard remembers Halores printing control units. Does that mean she made units to take with her and didn't take them out of dead hosts? I kind of believe Hector is inside of Tommy Flanagan's Martin, partly due to mannerisms and mostly because Lisa Joy suggested the idea as a maybe joke two years ago.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - No Dolores this episode, and William is still MIA despite his opening credits billing.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - The details added to Sizemore regarding his love for Maeve are hilarious. The weird drawings, the bust, the terrible flirtations, Simon Quarterman is awesome. A particularly stupid improvisation: "female codebreakers helped win World War II!" On a complimentary note, Maeve discerning that he didn't make it because he was being all flirty and "Lee Sizemore died a good man" did hit hard. I was impressed with how they salvaged his character in season two, and since he was billed in the opening credits as a main cast member I hope he does return in some form.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - On the other hand, rest in peace Rodrigo Santoro, who isn't being billed in the main cast and is likely serving as a guest star this season. If I'm right about the Martin host, at least Hector lives on.
      </p>

      <p class = "chicken">
        - Next week’s episode is titled “The Absence of Field”, directed by Amanda Marsalis and written by Denise Thé. It should give us more perspective on Charlotte Hale and whose control unit is inhabiting her body, and begin setting Dolores' plan into motion. I'm excited to see Tessa Thompson handle some tough material — if things go well, she might just nab her first Emmy nomination.
