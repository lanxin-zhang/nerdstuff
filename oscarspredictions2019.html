      <p class = "title"> 2019 Oscar Predictions</p>
      <p class = "differenttext">Few surprises are expected for surprisingly competitive categories as Academy voters continue to disappoint</p>
      <p class = "info">By Carson Zhang</p>
      <img src = "assets/2019 Oscars Title Picture.jpg">
      <p class = "chicken">
        An annual PSA that always bears mentioning: the Oscars are dumb, but they aren't irrelevant or unimportant. Along with box office results and critical reception, they ultimately decide which films continue to get made and which get axed. They're the reason why there's a couple of biopics every year where an actor gives a "transformative" performance largely defined by the makeup team. The Oscars often stick to bland, formulaic films that vanish from public discourse almost instantly, which is why studios continue to vomit unchallenging content like <i>Green Book</i> and <i>Shakespeare In Love</i>. However, every year there's usually a couple of truly impressive films that get recognized by the Academy. When a movie like <i>The Hurt Locker</i>, a commercial flop in spite of its creative achievements, takes top honors from <i>Avatar</i>, an average film that demolished box office records, it encourages studios to invest in more niche, daring ideas in order to win Oscars. When a good movie wins at the Oscars, it's a major step forward for the industry.

      <p class = "chicken">
        Another PSA that also bears mentioning around awards season: the Academy is an association of old white guys slowly being swarmed by diversity. (No political statement here, that is just how it is don't attack me.) That's why <i>1917</i> is the clear frontrunner and <i>Parasite</i> is on its heels. Bombastic performances and imitations of real people will usually triumph against better performances, Allison Janney's 2017 triumph over Laurie Metcalf being an obvious demonstration of that. 2017 is particularly worth mentioning this year, because this is only the second time in history since then that the acting winners of the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Critics' Choice, and BAFTAs have all lined up. Which means that the acting categories are basically locked. However, everything else seems sort of on the table as precursors split fairly evenly between competitors. Since I never get what I want, though, I'm just going to assume the Academy disappoints me at every turn for these predictions. Solid strategy. Also, I'm skipping Documentary and all Short Film categories because I have no idea what goes on for those. Confident I'll be around 55% right and edge out my physics exam.

          The list of nominees:<br>Antonio Banderas (<i>Pain and Glory</i>)<br>Leonardo DiCaprio (<i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</i>)<br>Adam Driver (<i>Marriage Story</i>)<br>Joaquin Phoenix (<i>Joker</i>)<br>Jonathan Pryce (<i>The Two Popes</i>)

        </p>

        <p class = "chicken">
          There's no doubt Phoenix will win this award. He's already been robbed of several wins and nominations, his campaigning has been full of liberal activism, and he's the only reason that <i>Joker</i> (which leads the nominations at 11) is in the conversation at all. The only others on his level in this category are Banderas and Driver. They won't award Banderas for such a subtle performance, and <i>Marriage Story</i> never picked up the traction it needed to win anything.

        <p class = "chicken">
          Erivo is lucky to be nominated, so she's not happening. Ronan is likely going to take the Kate Winslet route to her own Oscar, which means she won't be winning anytime soon. Johansson is a double nominee which bodes well for her, but the lack of support for <i>Marriage Story </i> is not promising. Theron is the closest to an upset thanks to the physical transformation, but <i>Judy</i> is Zellweger's big return to Hollywood. Playing an adored Hollywood icon after years of being incognito, her narrative is pretty much unstoppable.

          <br>Upset: Joe Pesci (<i>The Irishman</i>)
        </p>

        <p class = "chicken">
          Now this is a stacked category. I'd never think I'd live to see the day that Brad Pitt, one of our only remaining movie stars in an era of franchising, win an Oscar over four acting legends. His narrative is every bit as firm as Phoenix or Zellweger's, so it's happening. While he's actually won an Oscar for producing <i>12 Years A Slave</i>, people only care about acting Oscars and he's got none of those yet. Plus, while Phoenix has been a picture perfect illustration of what the Oscars aspire to be this entire awards season, Pitt has been setting the trail ablaze by being Brad Pitt. He's been charming, funny, and self-deprecating through every awards speech, and a picture of him and ex-wife Jennifer Aniston together was worth billions in advertising. It helps that Hopkins and Hanks aren't in Best Picture nominated films, and that Pacino and Pesci will split votes. If those split votes end up in a victor, though, my money's on Pesci as the critical favorite.

        <p class = "chicken">
          I liked Pugh in <i>Little Women</i> much more than Dern in <i>Marriage Story</i>, but this is a loss I can take. Laura Dern's always good but she rarely ever wins awards, so she's definitely got the overdue narrative going for her. Also, as it turns out, the irritating opinions of Twitter folk do not actually translate to Academy votes. Based on some brief polling, everyone loves Dern and her performance. She gets a lot of scathing material that's much flashier than anyone else's in this category, so I'm certain she's gonna win. Also, like everyone in this category besides Bates, Dern has another movie up her sleeve: <i>Little Women</i>, where she actually gave a better performance. While Johansson seems like a reasonable second place considering <i>Jojo Rabbit</i>'s strong showing, Pugh has that ingenue narrative going for her that voters love. And while Johansson has <i>Marriage Story</i> in her back pocket, Pugh has <i>Midsommar</i>. While many voters probably skipped it, those who didn't will definitely vote for the rising starlet.

        </p>

        <p class = "chicken">
          This category is awful. Like, Best Supporting Actress level awful. Zaillian has won no precursors, and neither have McCarten or Phillips and Silver. So, they're probably out. Gerwig got an early lead when <i>Little Women</i> began sweeping critic circles and took the Critics' Choice and USC Scripter awards, but Waititi snatched the edge with back-to-back wins at the Writers Guild of America and the BAFTAs. Those are much more valuable precursors, and <i>Little Women</i> will likely be dismissed by many voters for its decision to adapt the same novel an umpteenth time. Gerwig's narrative as a woman snubbed for Best Director works in her favor, but <i>Jojo Rabbit</i>'s Editing nomination suggests much more favor for Waititi's Nazi comedy.

        <p class = "chicken">
          I know I said I'd just assume the Academy would always pick what I didn't want, but I've got a little bit of hope for <i>Parasite</i> to take one big award on Oscar night. Tarantino won the Critics' Choice and Golden Globe, but he lost at BAFTA, a much more indicative precursor. And while he's ineligible at the Writers Guild of America, <i>Parasite</i> took a key win there. Baumbach has lost all steam and <i>1917</i> has no chance, so it seems like the odds are slightly in <i>Parasite</i>'s favor, especially since no Asians have ever won this award or something. On the other hand, Tarantino has won twice, so they probably won't feel bad about snubbing him.

        <p class = "chicken">
          If Phillips happens, I will laugh until my throat closes up and I die. But it won't. Voters won't pick Scorsese because he's already won and <i>The Irishman</i> failed to find a good awards narrative, while <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</i> is being pushed for writing over directing. Mendes has the technical achievement that awards bodies love, not to mention victories at the Critics' Choice, Golden Globes, Directors Guild of America and BAFTAs. So, he's pretty much a lock. The only chance Bong has is if they recognize that <i>Parasite</i> is extraordinarily crafted and far superior in every way, which won't happen.

        <p class = "chicken">
          While there are nine contenders, only three of them are worth really looking at. <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</i> won the Comedy Globe and Critics' Choice, but <i>1917</i> won the much more important Producers Guild of America and BAFTA awards, not to mention a Drama Globe as well. On top of that, it won the Director's Guild of America and American Society of Cinematographers awards. It's easily achieved frontrunner status and will likely take Best Picture and several other categories. There is a chance, however, that the rabid fanbase of <i>Parasite</i> just might win it Best Picture. <i>Parasite</i> won Foreign Language Film everywhere, but no international film has ever won Best Picture before. However, no international film has ever won the Screen Actors Guild Ensemble award either, and with such rapturous acclaim from the voting body. It also won the Writers Guild award, another first for international features, and the American Cinema Editors award as well. While <i>Hollywood</i> checks off all the boxes, I just don't think it has the passion behind it to topple a juggernaut like <i>1917</i>, especially after the latter film managed to score a writing nomination. However, <i>1917</i> did fail to nab a Screen Actors Guild Ensemble nomination or an Editing nomination at the Oscars over weaker contenders like <i>Jojo Rabbit</i>. However, the Editing omission might be attributed to the "one-take" style of the film, and the Ensemble statistic has been extremely inconsistent as of late. Its only threat at this point seems to be <i>Parasite</i>, which faces major barriers without any acting nominations, no big Picture wins at any ceremony, and the fact that its an international film. If <i>Roma</i>, a film made by a revered director and major awards contender, couldn't win with Netflix's $100 million marketing budget against a film like <i>Green Book</i>, I think it's safe to say that <i>1917</i> has this one in the bag.

          <br>Upset: <i>Toy Story 4</i>
        </p>

        <p class = "chicken">
          To be clear, <i>Toy Story 4</i> has way better odds than <i>Klaus</i>. And it's much better. However, surprising wins at the Annies and BAFTA have convinced me to take a gamble on <i>Klaus</i> over <i>Toy Story 4</i>. <i>Toy Story 4</i> did perform under expectations at the box office and its critical reception was a tad cool compared to previous installments in the franchise. Consequently, fatigue for <i>Toy Story</i> might propel <i>Klaus</i> to a surprise win. Possible, but unlikely.

        <p class = "chicken">
          I really can't think of a scenario in which Deakins loses, so I'm just going to put Pieto in second place. I'm surprised the Academy had the taste to nominate Blaschke, but with no other nominations <i>The Lighthouse</i> is definitely not winning. A film done in one-take style that's completely immersive and perfectly captures its lead's performance will not go unrecognized, not only because it's great but because it's a very obvious use of cinematography in storytelling.

        <p class = "chicken">
          Durran is apparently the frontrunner of this race, but she didn't even get a Costume Designers Guild nomination. Granted, the late release of <i>Little Women</i> might explain that, but there's a couple of factors that make me much more confident in Rubeo. A. <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> won the CDG award. B. <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> seems primed to block <i>Little Women</i> from winning anything as a more "original" yet conventional take. C. I want <i>Little Women</i> to win something so it'll definitely lose.

        <p class = "chicken">
          <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> is by far the flashiest nominee and will likely win, but <i>Parasite</i> is obviously the best edited picture. Those montage sequences are unbeatable. After taking the American Cinema Editors award, something <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i> won last year before getting the Oscar, there is a reasonable chance that <i>Parasite</i> upsets and takes the win.

          <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</i> won the Art Directors Guild award, one of few guild it wound up winning. Tarantino's film is a dreamy recreation of Hollywood's Golden Age, so the narcissistic Academy will surely vote for it.

          I have no idea how sound works, but <i>1917</i> is the technical triumph of the year so I'll guess that it wins.

          I think <i>1917</i> is the favorite here, but it's hard to believe the Academy would vote for a movie with sneaky visual effects over a movie with overt visual effects. I'm kinda anticipating that <i>The Lion King</i> will somehow win because it looks live-action, but for now I'll stick with <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> because its budget was crazy and Disney is campaigning like crazy to win at least one Oscar.
